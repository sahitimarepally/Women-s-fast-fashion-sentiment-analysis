It's about brand image, trends, and fashion. There is a difference between clothes and fashion. Walmart and Kohl's sell clothes. H&M does sell fashion via their clothes, at least. Clothing retailers at Walmart aren't concerned about trends, style, or signaling anything through clothing, they are concerned with providing affordable, accessible clothing to people who need it, which is a huge, important market that FFA doesn't discuss. Because they have zero interest in discussing the fashion needs of a size 28 rural woman whose closest mall is 4 hours away and closest Nordstrom is two states away.


Fashion is a form of conspicuous consumption, and the signaling that the brand image that Walmart and Kohl's currently provide isn't fashionable. Their clothes are considered cheap and frumpy and not something people with good style or taste would wear, even though stores with cheaper clothes (H&M, Primark, even Target) can be considered fashionable. 

Let's talk about the arguments people make. ""Ethics."" Most brands, unless they go out of their way to be sustainable, are unethical. Most brands use sweatshop labor and pay workers pennies. People like to tell themselves that that can't be true because they paid $300 for a garment, but they are wrong. Of course some brands are more unethical than others and Walmart is up there in terms of bad ones, but most ready-to-wear mall fashion is unethical. It just is. People think they're better than others because they shopped at Zara instead of Shein. They're not.

""Quality."" Unless someone can link me to some peer-reviewed studies comparing garments by cost and how they wear and break down, all we have is anecdotal evidence on quality. My garments that have held up the most have been from H&M and Target and the ones that have performed the worst have been from Anthropologie. Of course I have cheap stuff that fell apart and expensive stuff that held up, but it's more about fabrics, if the fabric is suited to the type of garment, and how you care for it and wear it. Unlike others on FFA, I do not wash my clothes with razor blades so I don't have issues with my clothes falling apart usually.

""Sustainability"". Buying new clothes is not sustainable no matter where you buy them. That one's easy!

It boils down to brand image and conspicuous consumption for the most part. FFA ignores that Nordstroms are only in high-end malls in certain states and that probably 70% of American women couldn't shop at Aritzia even if they wanted to since all of their sizing stops at a L and they run small. People like to look rich and feel skinny. Don't believe anything else.",0.1400376533189033,0.5571484938672439,positive
Zara,"You know what - I LOVE Kohls, Target, H&M, Zara, etc. But i've also found that their stuff can also be just as expensive as other brands.

For me, I am an APPLE SHAPE. Any other Apple shaped people out there? Shopping for my specific body type is ROUGH and once I find a brand that works, I typically stick to it and it usually means buying more quality pieces and getting 2-3 of them instead of buying tons of cheaper clothes that just look like shit on me. I have to wear clothes that have a little more structure to them and that often means more expensive.",-0.011011904761904754,0.4875,neutral
Zara,"Aritzia quality used to be good and their collections were very well coordinated, however their quality has started to fall off recently. I feel that the more consumers they've started to reach, the less they put effort into (some of) their pieces. I used to love their Babaton line but with all the synthetic materials they've started to use I've started to veer away from them a tiny bit. That's also why they get mentioned a lot here, because they are popular and mostly on trend plus cater to the age group that I think the average redditor user is in. As for Nordstrom, they're essentially just a department store with a wide range of brands, so you can find a 30 dollar dress right next to the 300 dollar one.   
However, to answer your question - yes there is a difference in both the quality and durability of clothing depending on the brand you buy from and often the materials they use as well. This is especially true for items like knitwear, bags, shoes, jeans, sometimes outerwear (especially when it comes to down). Cashmere and wool sweaters from cheaper brands tend to pill easily and develop holes much faster than those from more expensive or even luxury brands. For example, I have cashmere sweaters, some which cost over 300 euros, but I've been wearing them for years and years now but they still look and feel amazing. The initial cost for a good quality purchase may seem daunting at first, but when you think of how much use you will get out of it vs potentially having to buy a new cheap sweater every season or every year, then it really balances things out in my opinion. Of course, something having a higher price tag doesn't always automatically mean it will be a great buy - my initial comment on Aritzia can be used as an example of this.  
To sum up, I buy from more expensive brands because they last me longer, are of a higher quality, usually fit better and use natural fibers or at least have the composition consist of majority natural fibers, as opposed to cheaper/fast fashion where the top materials are always synthetics with maybe 10% of wool thrown in. For those who are on a strict budget and can't afford these kind of purchases, it helps to plan out your clothing expenses over the year and the other thing is that you can find incredible things at the thrift store and second hand stores.  
Ethical fashion is also becoming more popular and many people don't want to support companies, which use child labor or refuse to give their workers a humane wage and respectable working conditions. Such reasons are also why I refuse to shop at Zara for example and I think Walmart and Target share similar issues. Zara prides themselves on always being the first one's to shell out trends to the masses, but at what cost? :) I don't want to support brands like that, which is another reason I veer towards more expensive or luxury brands. Many of these brands also create less clothing per every season or collection, which means that there will not be so much textile etc that will just be thrown away and there is less pollution etc during the manufacturing of clothing.",0.2197243078102453,0.4899736764971138,positive
Zara,"I can't talk about why others recommend those stores but I can definitely say why I’m recommending them. First yes, I can afford those stores though I mostly shop on sales and rarely pay a full price in there. 

The more important reasons why I recommend stores like Aritzia or OtherStories or COS. 
1. they have more modern cut clothes. Like i’m in love with these [House of Dagmar ](https://www.houseofdagmar.com/us/valentina-flannel) trousers. I simply won't find anything similar in Target or Kohls period.
2. Target/Walmart are not that cheap. I love to shop at Target for home decor and cleaning supplies and at first made a great effort to explore their clothing section. My summary: tons of acrylics for not so cheap prices. $30 is a regular sweater price. I can buy a wool Uniqlo sweater for only $10 more. This summer I bought at Uniqlo gorgeous 50%cotton 50%silk sweater for $15. $15! Silk! Full price was $49. So most of the time it's just doesn't make sense to me to shop at Target.
3. Target/Walmart etc have a big variety but don't have an “identity” so to say. It's a vast ocean of clothes with different styles and qualities. To find something good is very much like thrifting when I need to put a lot of effort to go through a lot of clothes to find something I like. I do love some of my Target clothes for home lounging. Absolutely love this [hoodie sweater ](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-crewneck-hooded-pullover-sweater-a-new-day/-/A-83904169?preselect=82389002#lnk=sametab). 
4. Zara and H&M are harder cause they are the epitome of fast fashion. They cover a vast range of trends and change them in a heartbeat. There are great collections but they go and can be changed by something not so great. So it is just hard to keep up with everything and in turn, recommend. The sweater or pants I loved won't be there in a month and will never come back. I do look at H&M and Zara for cheaper options. Like the trousers above I found similar on Asos.",0.3067083333333333,0.5438099816849817,positive

Zara,"More expensive brands are often (though definitely not only!) better quality. Though some brands have more ""ethical"" labor practices than others, I don't really think that that is what is going on at a store like Nordstrom. If people don't specify a budget, something pricier is typically going to be a better option than something cheaper in terms of fit, construction, fabric, etc, along with style. 

When people request a lower budget, I do see people recommend brands like Uniqlo, Zara, and H&M. I even see Old Navy and Target. The first three in particular are typically found in cities and tend to copy more current designer trends. Kohl's and Walmart are typically far more rural/more lower-middle class and working class suburbs. And whether people address it or not, I think there is some sizism and racial bias against brands associated mainly with Black people. This isn't to say that people here are racist or sizist but rather that there are some biases that shape what brands are seen as fashionable or not fashionable, e.g. I never see recommendations here for stores like Rainbow even though I don't think the labor practices are so different from say H&M. Difference is where the different stores are located and who they serve. Now many more companies are carrying larger sizes, but Uniqlo, Zara, and H&M are Japanese and European budget brands that only carry straight sizes (or at least that was the case historically). 

In terms of my own shopping practices, I rarely shop at stores like Nordstrom because the prices feel very inflated and brick and mortars rarely keep sale merchandise in stock. 10-15 years ago, department stores had the benefit of being somewhere you could go and try things on in-person, but that hasn't been my experience recently. Nowadays I save up for some more specialty small brands and then buy vintage and nicer brands secondhand. So while I am not sure a $300 dress is more worth it than a $50 one, but a secondhand version of the same thing for $80-100 often is worth it to me. Higher price doesn't necessarily mean good quality, but good quality comes at a higher cost if that makes sense.",0.16741666666666666,0.4776944444444446,positive
Zara,"I recently moved and while packing, I found a sweater I bought around 10 years ago. It's been a while since I saw it, and I was pretty surprised it was from Forever21. I never see quality like this in Forever 21 anymore.

The cost of production is slowly crawling up over the years. A lot of the cheaper brands maintained the same price, but went down significantly in quality.

Also some of the cheaper brands aren't even cheap anymore.  I saw a blazer in Zara the other day, the button was plastic and there's no inner lining. It was $149. Seriously?  For $100 more you can get a much better quality jacket from Club Monaco or Ted Baker.

In terms of your question about quality, this is my personal opinion : Anything between $150 to $300 is **significantly** better made than items under $150. It also lasts a lot longer, and doesn't go out of shape or thinned out as quickly.  The durability difference between the two is very noticeable.

The difference in material between a cheaper item and one in the $150 - $300 range is also pretty huge. If I'm at a meeting with a someone, I can visibly tell the difference immediately after sitting down.  As for anything over $300, it's usually the same quality as the items in the $150 - $300 range, and you're mostly paying premium for the brand or logo.

Zara,"I was a long-time ASOS loyalist, about 6 years I think. Stopped last March because of something petty on my end. But before that, they were the only brand I shopped at, most of their stuff was under the $50-60 range and the BIGGEST seller of their shopping experience is that they were one of the first online stores to have a video of every single piece of clothing. As someone who has a small waist and is pretty busty, it really helped watching how the fabric pulled and moved on the models. Also returning was so easy because they included a label. I just slapped it on and took it with me to work and had it shipped from there.  2-day shipping for a year for $27+.

I used to shop at H&M and Zara a lot when I was in my early twenties, but I feel like everything on the rack is so cheaply made. You really have to scour the store and it's a hot mess.

I don't shop at Walmart or Kohls because all the items kind of give me a headache to sift through. I also feel like a lot of the product is cheaply made and mishandled by other people. The makeup section at Kohls, Ross, and TJ Max is pretty gross.",0.16904761904761909,0.5130325814536342,positive
Zara,"Personally, I've been starting to be more focused on the composition and how ecologically sound the pieces of my wardrobe are as I try to start building my capsule wardrobe. E.g. if I can find a good basic that is 100% cotton or 100% cotton-lyocell/bamboo mix I will gladly pay a bit more for it. That being said, H&M has some decent and affordable options and I've bought them there in the past.

However, I'm also trying to get more into slow fashion, and really buying clothing that is made really well. But for me this means looking beyond H&M as well as Nordstrom/ASOS, towards thrifting, buying second hand, making sure I'm not buying plastic-/petroleum-based/synthetic-fibre materials--especially the latter leads to microfibers ending up in water sources when you wash clothing. So for me, sometimes that means spending 50 $/euro on a dress or shirt as opposed to 15 $/euro on a shirt.

This of course isn't to say that I don't own anything that I bought from years past that is synthetic. I have, and I've found that some of those (as others also say in the comments) from H&M/Zara/Mango have held up really well and are still pieces I use.

Zara,"I can’t speak for everyone, but 90% of my wardrobe is from Poshmark, my quarterly clothing swaps, vintage shops, consignment/resale shops like Crossroads/Buffalo Exchange, or cheaper thrift shops like Goodwill or Out of the Closet.

I think it’s because of the issues you’ve laid out in your post: quality and style. I see plenty of H&M, F21, Zara at those shops but I just rarely buy them. They tend to be pieces that were very trendy for a moment that has passed: shirts with cold shoulders or attached collars, the ubiquitous olive parka with drawstring waist of the aughts, you know what I mean. Fast fashion brands create hella product that turns the dial up on those flash in the pan trends. We joke about it all the time. They also make cute, timeless pieces…and the people who bought them are more likely to hang onto them. 

As far as Kohl’s, JCPenney, Walmart - being honest, I don’t think they are considered tastemakers. I think that millennials were probably the last generation to grow up choosing to get their clothing from big box stores. Target is holding on with 10 fingers and 10 toes lol but I hear my younger cousins and coworkers (I am 33 btw) talking more about visiting storefronts or thrifting.

Fashion is a form of conspicuous consumption, and the signaling that the brand image that Walmart and Kohl's currently provide isn't fashionable. Their clothes are considered cheap and frumpy and not something people with good style or taste would wear, even though stores with cheaper clothes (H&M, Primark, even Target) can be considered fashionable. 

Let's talk about the arguments people make. ""Ethics."" Most brands, unless they go out of their way to be sustainable, are unethical. Most brands use sweatshop labor and pay workers pennies. People like to tell themselves that that can't be true because they paid $300 for a garment, but they are wrong. Of course some brands are more unethical than others and Walmart is up there in terms of bad ones, but most ready-to-wear mall fashion is unethical. It just is. People think they're better than others because they shopped at Zara instead of Shein. They're not.

""Quality."" Unless someone can link me to some peer-reviewed studies comparing garments by cost and how they wear and break down, all we have is anecdotal evidence on quality. My garments that have held up the most have been from H&M and Target and the ones that have performed the worst have been from Anthropologie. Of course I have cheap stuff that fell apart and expensive stuff that held up, but it's more about fabrics, if the fabric is suited to the type of garment, and how you care for it and wear it. Unlike others on FFA, I do not wash my clothes with razor blades so I don't have issues with my clothes falling apart usually.

""Sustainability"". Buying new clothes is not sustainable no matter where you buy them. That one's easy!

It boils down to brand image and conspicuous consumption for the most part. FFA ignores that Nordstroms are only in high-end malls in certain states and that probably 70% of American women couldn't shop at Aritzia even if they wanted to since all of their sizing stops at a L and they run small. People like to look rich and feel skinny. Don't believe anything else.",0.1400376533189033,0.5571484938672439,positive
H&M,"I am a bigger girl (5""4, somewhere around 185 lbs, with a distinct hourglass bordering on pear-shaped body).

I like Aritzia because I know the exact items that suit my body type and I feel their tops, despite the obvious decline in quality, still have much better draping than your average item at say h&m. I do still shop at h&m occasionally but those are rarer occasions because I think the items tend to be less flattering.

I am also absolutely not sifting through garbage websites (walmart.ca no thank you).

The more I shop online the more I am going to rely on stores where I know what the fit is like, is consistent, has good return policies, people leave quality reviews, etc. Nordstrom has an amazing return policy in my experience.

And I agree with others that people providing advice and comments here are people who *actually enjoy fashion* and therefore will be more likely to spend more money on their clothes ergo they end up recommending higher-end places.

I actually believe the best way to a well-rounded closet is a good mix of higher quality workhorse pieces (for me that means blazers, black jeans, knits, multi-season skirts) interspersed with cheaper options like tank tops and sundresses from old Navy, oversized button-downs on sale at the gap, trendy items at h&m, weekend jeans from AE and keeping an eye out for sales.",0.28717948717948716,0.4701923076923077,positive
H&M,"I can think of a few reasons:

\- Personally, I live in a downtown area and don't have a Kohl's, Walmart, Target, etc. anywhere near me (or I have small city versions without a clothing section). I could probably shop them online, but I generally jut don't shop for clothes online that often.  

\- I'm more likely to recommend a specific brand rather than a department store like Nordstrom or Kohls that carry a variety of brands. 

\- I know a lot of people are trying to get away from more fast fashion brands. I do feel like I see H&M recommended a fair amount, but I also see a lot of posts asking for higher quality or non-fast fashion options.

\- Depending on the posts here, some people are looking for more ""fashion"" advice while others are looking for things like basics. While stores like walmart and kohls definitely fulfill many needs, if someone is asking for a more specific style or item, a store like Aritzia or J Crew might just be a better rec

\- Honestly a lot of it is personal perception of these brands. Some people just don't want to shop at kohls or view it as lower quality. A lot of people are willing to spend more money pn clothing. 

I personally have clothes from Target, H&M, TJ Maxx, etc. and also have clothing from more expensive stores like Aritzia, J Crew, Club Monaco, etc. But the second options are (overall) items that have held up better over time and stores with a more distinct style, so I'd probably be more likely to recommend them.",0.22301136363636362,0.48125000000000007,positive
H&M,"I joined this thread fairly recently and it’s pretty mental. I don’t know if there’s a cultural difference but people are asking for handbag recommendations under $500 and I’m like.. ummm, this £20 bag from H&M might be nice??? I dunno - some of the budgets and shop recommendations are here are crazy. I wouldn’t say I’m fashionable on a budget - but this thread is very much so branded 😅",0.07285714285714286,0.53,mixed
H&M,"Nordstrom and ASOS have alot of items under $100, often under $50 too. I don't have experience with Aritzia so unsure about them. I have definitely seen H&M and Kohl's mentioned here before, but not Walmart.

I think you're greatly exaggerating the price differences. Nordstrom and ASOS has plenty of dresses that are below $100 and $50, so the comparison isn't as extreme as you're suggesting.

Stores like ASOS, Aritzia, and H&M get more attention because they tend to be trendier and/or have distinctive styles. Stores like Nordstrom and Kohl's are department stores that do follow trends, but are slower to do so, and don't spend nearly as much on marketing fashion as the other clothing brands. (Though Nordstrom does alot more than Kohl's, of course.)

The stores that market fashion alot, spend more on photography, models, posing - that all look much better. Often (though not always), their clothes are more likely to be better quality as well since clothing is their focus. Walmart doesn't bother because fashion isn't their end game. It's easier to recommend stores that have distinct styles, are trendy, have better pictures, and also likely have better quality.

As for ethical reasons, honestly at this point, pretty all new clothing is unethical. Some of us may select particular stores to shop from because they are marginally ""less"" unethical (e.g. instead of using slaves, they pay workers cents for working all day in terrible conditions). But at the end of the day, if that clothing item isn't produced here in the US and workers aren't making minimum wage, then the clothing is most likely unethical in some way. I choose to minimize my clothing purchases per year, and thrift alot, to avoid buying new clothes at all.

I choose to buy from pricier stores because they tend to have better quality and better fitting clothes. Does this mean I buy only $300 dresses? No (though nothing wrong with that). This does mean that I'd rather buy $50 dress from Loft (one of my favorite stores) than a $30 dress from Walmart, because I much prefer the silhouettes and colors and patterns I find at Loft compared to Walmart, and because the clothing feels like much better quality.

I also think you're missing the fact that people prioritize different clothing items and have different budgets for them. I bought cheap socks from Kohl's because I don't care about socks and I just need something on my feet to wear with shoes. I did spend a few hundred dollars on a high quality down jacket for winter because I live in a cold climate. I've never spent >$50 on regular dress. Never spent >$100 on a formal event dress. I do have some great items from H&M that were as cheap as Walmart, but much cuter.",0.1639346293119878,0.5568849599038279,positive
H&M,"I’m Australian, but H&M isn’t super cheap like most of their stuff starts at around $30 (I saw a blazer for $70) except their staples like tees. However the majority of quality is abysmal and their range is really weird and I don’t know who it’s aimed at? Maybe it’s trendy in Europe and aimed at older people 35+ but there seems to be a lot of nothing and both my local stores normally have like 1 person looking at a time.

All their shirts are flimsy and even if they are $10 that’s another $10 you will need in a couple of months when you need to replace it after it falls apart.

Clothing is really pretty expensive here (most tees $35 for fast fashion store and $60 for brand Adidas/Lee/Stussy and fashion store skirts and dresses $50-100) and even so people would rather spend more money buying things that will last a couple of years as it works out more cost effective long term and you actually end up spending less money.

The key is to buy quality staples and pieces that are on trend but not super on trend (think the huge leg of mutton sleeves at the moment or crossover wrap under boob tops which will be noticeably out of fashion next year, swap them for a smaller puff sleeve or crop tank with a print/linen/boucle that you can wear next year).",0.14294871794871797,0.5019230769230769,positive
H&M,"I tend to use brand names not store names. 

There are probably 100 brand names sold by Walmart. I have a Daily Ritual dress I really like that's sold by both Walmart and Amazon. I won't say ""Oh, it's a dress from Walmart"" I'll say ""Oh, it's Daily Ritual.""

Same with Kohls, I'd use the brand name not the store name. 

H&M is a brand name, but I think people are generally moving away from brands like that because of how bad we know fast fashion is, and how poor of quality their clothes tend to be. 

Aritzia isn't just one brand, but the brands it carries is just about four, so it has a cohesive ""look."" ASOS is also a collection of brands, but also kind of has a ""look"" to it.

I personally wouldn't buy clothes at Walmart, Kohls or H&M because I find Walmart and Kohls to be frumpy and cheaply made. I disagree with H&Ms business model.",0.03181818181818183,0.4174242424242424,neutral
H&M,"Wal mart actually does have a line, Free Assembly, that is cute, and most of it is actual cotton (and even recycled organic cotton, which seems surprising). I only know because it started showing up on my social media and then I browsed it. I haven't purchased anything from it, so I can't comment on what it's like in real life. Marketing people are not dumb, so I am sure they are trying to improve their image.

Look, I understand people wanting to buy ethical and long lasting fashion, but even the expensive, high quality brands are now almost all same shitty polyester fabric and is made overseas in sweatshops, but marked up. I went to Anthropologie for the first time in years, and many of the dresses I tried on was 100% polyester, but they cost $150+. Why is Anthropologie's polyester any better than H&M's? Even LL Bean, where a fleece costs like $100, makes most of its stuff in China now. Pretty much all the retailers treat their workers poorly and don't offer benefits. I'm not justifying buying less ethical clothing, but pointing out that I'm not sure any of them are truly ethical in the world of capitalism. I think some brands are just better at presenting themselves.

I don't know, at this point I just look at fabric content of what I am buying rather than the brand and try to stay within a certain budget. I also try to thrift from time to time as well. 

Finally, I do think there may be a bit of classism going on.",0.16963913690476193,0.5181522817460317,positive
H&M,"The places you listed are not created equally. Asos & Nordstrom are fashion&home retailers that have in-house brands but also carry stuff from all price ranges. Aritzia is a mid-range fashion brand that focuses on design/fabric. H&M is an inexpensive clothing retailer and Walmart is not a fashion retailer but carries limited inexpensive clothing. 

When I buy from Nordstrom, it's usually pieces on sale from other brands I like and can spend a little less for something I will get good value from (spanx, soma, girlfriend). When I buy from Aritzia, it's a splurge from an item that might have really good quality fabric (like a nice linen dress) or design. When I buy from Asos, it's trendy pieces with ok fabric content that I have specific occasion for. For instance my last purchase from Asos was $80 for 3 items(100% cotton cardigan and dress, a bodysuit) and Nordstom purchase was $90 for 2 items(bra, shoes), Aritzia purchase was $90 for one item(linen dress). When I buy from Walmart/Target/H&M it might be a basic that I don't want to spend too much on. 

Paying $100 for a shirt from Nordies doesn't really mean you are getting a better quality shirt - it might mean better fabric, trendy cut or just a brand name. Some brands are known for their fabric content and design (""quality"") and ethical practices (fair wage, no virgin plastic). These all play a part in the price but brand name will always be a big part of cost as well. 

I know it's a complicated answer, tldr: your milage will vary. A $10 tshirt from Target might be the best thing and $50 tshirt from Norstrom might come out the wash with holes. Check fabric content, ethical practices (if they matter to you and fit in your budget), design and craftsmanship (seams, lining, threading) before deciding an item is worth the price for you.",0.20622874149659867,0.46343537414965985,positive

The main reason I don't shop there is because the clothing and shoes are terrible quality. I used to buy leggings or sweaters at Walmart that would last for years. Now everything falls apart with a couple of wears; this includes washing in cold water on the delicate cycle and drying with the air only setting. The leggings and pj pants unravel after about two wears. The sweaters get holes or lose shape.

H&M and Kohl’s are constantly switching out their fast fashions and trends - I don’t want to look in my closet in a year or so and feel like all my clothes are out of season. I researched and planned and created a timeless capsule wardrobe list catered to my shape and size, wrote down the trustworthy brands of clothes that are built to last and where they’re sold, and when I need something for my capsule wardrobe I try to buy it from that list. That doesn’t mean I have to spend hundreds on a pair of pants at Nordstrom or Bloomies, though - most of the time I’m looking in secondhand stores like Goodwill, curated thrift stores like Buffalo Exchange, or online thrift stores like ThredUp and Depop, eBay, Etsy, etc. You would be SHOCKED at how much of a different it makes to get clothes tailored, too - if it’s a piece I‘ll wear a lot (like a blazer), I will buy one that’s a trustworthy brand and material at Goodwill and then get it dry cleaned and tailored to me, and then I’ll look like I spent $200.

H&M,"So here's my experience

I disagree that Nordstrom has to be that expensive, they do have sales and Nordstrom Rack. I've been shopping at Nordstrom for since I was a teen and going with my mom and grandma. They're a good department store--they have clothing for teens and adults and older adults. I think they also do a decent job at being aspirational but relatively attainable too.

Kohl's occasionally has decent items, but overall the design and quality isn't great for women's clothing. The textiles used don't feel as nice in the women's section. I think they're fine for men's clothes and will occasionally snag a men's sweater from clearance. But I'd sooner buy my cheap basics from Target or Uniqlo. 
I stopped shopping at H&M after college because there wasn't one near me and the sizing runs really small in the bust for my size. I was a size 8/10 and often wearing the largest size there which felt crappy so I stopped. It's for cheap, trendy clothes for smaller bodied people but it doesn't translate to the clothes I wear in my 30s.

H&M,"I can't talk about why others recommend those stores but I can definitely say why I’m recommending them. First yes, I can afford those stores though I mostly shop on sales and rarely pay a full price in there. 

The more important reasons why I recommend stores like Aritzia or OtherStories or COS. 
1. they have more modern cut clothes. Like i’m in love with these [House of Dagmar ](https://www.houseofdagmar.com/us/valentina-flannel) trousers. I simply won't find anything similar in Target or Kohls period.
2. Target/Walmart are not that cheap. I love to shop at Target for home decor and cleaning supplies and at first made a great effort to explore their clothing section. My summary: tons of acrylics for not so cheap prices. $30 is a regular sweater price. I can buy a wool Uniqlo sweater for only $10 more. This summer I bought at Uniqlo gorgeous 50%cotton 50%silk sweater for $15. $15! Silk! Full price was $49. So most of the time it's just doesn't make sense to me to shop at Target.
3. Target/Walmart etc have a big variety but don't have an “identity” so to say. It's a vast ocean of clothes with different styles and qualities. To find something good is very much like thrifting when I need to put a lot of effort to go through a lot of clothes to find something I like. I do love some of my Target clothes for home lounging. Absolutely love this [hoodie sweater ](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-crewneck-hooded-pullover-sweater-a-new-day/-/A-83904169?preselect=82389002#lnk=sametab). 
4. Zara and H&M are harder cause they are the epitome of fast fashion. They cover a vast range of trends and change them in a heartbeat. There are great collections but they go and can be changed by something not so great. So it is just hard to keep up with everything and in turn, recommend. The sweater or pants I loved won't be there in a month and will never come back. I do look at H&M and Zara for cheaper options.

H&M,"I think for a lot of people, the first list of stores/brands you mentioned provide a good balance between design and quality, so that's why they're popular.

I've never shopped there, but I imagine Kohls is reasonably high quality, but less stylish.

I personally buy stuff at a variety of price points.  I aim to pay as little as I can to achieve the look and comfort that I'm after.  If I can get what I want at somewhere like Uniqlo, I will. If the cheaper stuff doesn't meet my needs, I'll look to more expensive brands.  Often your personal body shape (how *average* you are in different areas) will dictate where you can go cheap, and where you need to spend more.  For me, I only buy cheap t-shirts, I spend more on jeans, and jackets I usually either have made to measure, or have to pay a fair bit for alterations.",0.17923333333333336,0.5426,positive
H&M,"More expensive brands are often (though definitely not only!) better quality. Though some brands have more ""ethical"" labor practices than others, I don't really think that that is what is going on at a store like Nordstrom. If people don't specify a budget, something pricier is typically going to be a better option than something cheaper in terms of fit, construction, fabric, etc, along with style. 

When people request a lower budget, I do see people recommend brands like Uniqlo, Zara, and H&M. I even see Old Navy and Target. The first three in particular are typically found in cities and tend to copy more current designer trends. Kohl's and Walmart are typically far more rural/more lower-middle class and working class suburbs. And whether people address it or not, I think there is some sizism and racial bias against brands associated mainly with Black people. This isn't to say that people here are racist or sizist but rather that there are some biases that shape what brands are seen as fashionable or not fashionable, e.g. I never see recommendations here for stores like Rainbow even though I don't think the labor practices are so different from say H&M. Difference is where the different stores are located and who they serve. Now many more companies are carrying larger sizes, but Uniqlo, Zara, and H&M are Japanese and European budget brands that only carry straight sizes (or at least that was the case historically). 

In terms of my own shopping practices, I rarely shop at stores like Nordstrom because the prices feel very inflated and brick and mortars rarely keep sale merchandise in stock. 10-15 years ago, department stores had the benefit of being somewhere you could go and try things on in-person, but that hasn't been my experience recently. Nowadays I save up for some more specialty small brands and then buy vintage and nicer brands secondhand. So while I am not sure a $300 dress is more worth it than a $50 one, but a secondhand version of the same thing for $80-100 often is worth it to me.

H&M,"Generally speaking I’d say more expensive things are more likely to be better made. But price and quality are not a guarantee at all. 

I’ll share my own experiences as well as some assumptions. 

Personally I do not shop at Kohl’s, Walmart, or H&M any more. There are a few reasons: 
- H&M: sizing (I straddled the top of their size chart, and by they time the launched plus I was over it. Quality for me was hit and miss. And i didn’t like the trends so there was no reason to go in there if I hated the trends. And way too many [racist ](https://theundefeated.com/whhw/hms-coolest-monkey-hoodie-and-how-racism-wastes-our-precious-time/) incidents. So I put them on the permanent no list. But H&M is pretty accessible for me.  
- Walmart: when I lived in a suburb that had a Walmart, my income was lower. I went all the time. I found Walmart to be much less stylish than Target. They have improved their trend orientation, but Walmart is like 30 miles away for me. I am not making a special trip on the off chance Walmart has something cute. 
- Kohls: I used to shop here when I worked in suburbia. But then I didn’t, it was too far. I found that sizing was hit and miss. And trend/fashion level are hit and miss. Over time they killed the brands I liked and I don’t see anything I like.  Also the closest stores are a 20 minute drive. And 40 minutes in transit.  And they aren’t by anything else I want to go to. 

I don’t really like to shop online. And I prefer to return in person. Most of those stores are pretty inaccessible and out of the way for me. For many of use in more urban areas - Kohls and Walmart don’t even exist. I live in the Bay Area of California, it is a huge metro. We have like 5 Walmarts in the entire region, and not in the center urban part. There are maybe 5 Kohls as well in the core part of the region.  There are more H&Ms then Walmarts here. 

Secondly, lots of FFA posters are concerned with “ethics” and these brands tend to contribute to manufacturing waste and labor abuses.  

Third, many people here are high income (and a bit older).

H&M,"I think part of it is that h&m, kohls, and walmart tend to lean into fast fashion pretty hard and that most of the clothes there (imo) are not in style year after year, and depending on the pieces don't last all tht long. Specific items like socks, underwear, tank tops, night wear and specific brands like hanes and so on at Walmart are reliable and if you find them acceptable, they are pretty cheap and of consistent quality. 

What I've found (though to be fair, I have a decent full time job, so I can afford it) is that it's more satisfying to go after better brands (often for specific things) but also buy only a few pieces a season, mostly to replace worn out clothes. I also find at the stores you've mentioned, clothes don't fit me very well, they are thin, their seams don't stand up as well, and they often make knock offs of other designers.

H&M,"For starters, I'd put stores like Kohl's, H&M, and Wal-Mart in COMPLETELY different categories. Kohl's is like discount mom clothes about two years out of fashion, H&M is hypertrendy but dressy fast fashion + cheap basics, and Wal-Mart is just utter sheer garbage, extremely cheap, ill-fitting on virtually everyone, and likely a couple seasons out of fashion.

None of them fit the profile of the average FFA subscriber, which is someone who is probably upper middle class, around age 25-35, sometimes follows trends, and chooses comfort and quality over style (the MANY discussions I've seen of mid to older millennials saying they'll never give up their $100 midrise stretch skinny jeans is really a perfect example of what I mean). They go for more classic silhouettes that wouldn't really look super out of place on anyone in the past 15 years, but also not particularly trendy or stylish. They also tend to be willing to spring for the more expensive item that's higher quality, made to last years, and more ethically and sustainably made.

Kohl's is too dated (in addition to a lot of people probably having bad memories of being dragged there or similar stores by your mom in middle school--at least I do, I wouldn't be caught dead at a Burlington or JCPenney's now except for Christmas shopping and the occasional purse). H+M is too trendy and also too cheaply made--they do have many items that are more timeless though, like midi dresses and basic sweaters, and I actually do see those kinds of items recommended somewhat frequently, in contrast to a place like Forever 21, which is rarely recommended. Wal-Mart is the worst of both of them, as it's unethically made, poorly made (stuff from the other two categories of stores are at least somewhat likely to both fit well and last), and generally pretty out of date. 

(And just to be clear, I don't ONLY mean those examples. I mean any store in a similar vein, in addition to other stores like Shein that are super trendy but also blatantly unethical and poorly made, along with just being a shitty business overall.)

Places like Nordstrom and Aritzia tick more of the average FFA user's boxes. They're likely higher quality, so will probably last more than a few seasons and fit more consistently. They're in budget, especially with a slight discount. And it's the right style--classy, not super loud, bold, or sexy, and unlikely to look outdated anytime soon.",0.07802700348432053,0.5270107433217187,mixed
H&M,"I was a long-time ASOS loyalist, about 6 years I think. Stopped last March because of something petty on my end. But before that, they were the only brand I shopped at, most of their stuff was under the $50-60 range and the BIGGEST seller of their shopping experience is that they were one of the first online stores to have a video of every single piece of clothing. As someone who has a small waist and is pretty busty, it really helped watching how the fabric pulled and moved on the models. Also returning was so easy because they included a label. I just slapped it on and took it with me to work and had it shipped from there.  2-day shipping for a year for $27+.

I used to shop at H&M and Zara a lot when I was in my early twenties, but I feel like everything on the rack is so cheaply made. You really have to scour the store and it's a hot mess.

I don't shop at Walmart or Kohls because all the items kind of give me a headache to sift through. I also feel like a lot of the product is cheaply made and mishandled by other people. The makeup section at Kohls, Ross, and TJ Max is pretty gross.",0.16904761904761909,0.5130325814536342,positive

H&M,"I think while there are many reasons, you can't deny that it's because people in this sub want to differentiate themselves from the masses, and want to seem better: more environmentally conscious, more stylish, smarter (because they buy more quality items). But the truth is, 90 % of these promises the brands mentioned in this sub make aren't fullfilled; neither the quality of the item at Nordstrom is better, nor the amount they pay their workers etc. The only truly better thing those brands do is keep an image of those things, as well as an exclusivity of those positive aspects. Which ""justifies"" the higher price. 
Which is why, even when I like the pieces that are recommended in this sub, I will go out and find a cheaper alternative. Because the 90 € linen dress I have that was made here in Europe, is just not as good quality as the linen dress I have from H&M, that I bought in sale for 10 €.

H&M,"Personally, I've been starting to be more focused on the composition and how ecologically sound the pieces of my wardrobe are as I try to start building my capsule wardrobe. E.g. if I can find a good basic that is 100% cotton or 100% cotton-lyocell/bamboo mix I will gladly pay a bit more for it. That being said, H&M has some decent and affordable options and I've bought them there in the past.

However, I'm also trying to get more into slow fashion, and really buying clothing that is made really well. But for me this means looking beyond H&M as well as Nordstrom/ASOS, towards thrifting, buying second hand, making sure I'm not buying plastic-/petroleum-based/synthetic-fibre materials--especially the latter leads to microfibers ending up in water sources when you wash clothing. So for me, sometimes that means spending 50 $/euro on a dress or shirt as opposed to 15 $/euro on a shirt.

This of course isn't to say that I don't own anything that I bought from years past that is synthetic. I have, and I've found that some of those (as others also say in the comments) from H&M/Zara/Mango have held up really well and are still pieces I use.

I think it’s because of the issues you’ve laid out in your post: quality and style. I see plenty of H&M, F21, Zara at those shops but I just rarely buy them. They tend to be pieces that were very trendy for a moment that has passed: shirts with cold shoulders or attached collars, the ubiquitous olive parka with drawstring waist of the aughts, you know what I mean. Fast fashion brands create hella product that turns the dial up on those flash in the pan trends. We joke about it all the time. They also make cute, timeless pieces…and the people who bought them are more likely to hang onto them. 

As far as Kohl’s, JCPenney, Walmart - being honest, I don’t think they are considered tastemakers. I think that millennials were probably the last generation to grow up choosing to get their clothing from big box stores. Target is holding on with 10 fingers and 10 toes lol but I hear my younger cousins and coworkers (I am 33 btw) talking more about visiting storefronts or thrifting.

H&M,"To answer the question though--I assume it is age bracket and income bracket. Wal-Mart and Kohl's is actually for everyone, but young people tend to have more clothes marketed *at* them from brands like Aritzia, Reformation, etc. And if you're middle-class I think Aritzia and Reformation are the new young professional brands?

I think that there is definitely a cost saturation point on like--a button down. But $50 vs $300 dollars for a shirt is a complicated question? Who makes the $300 dollar shirt? Is it completely made of silk that was ethically farmed? I imagine something like that could cost between $100-300 dollars depending on *where* on the planet the shirt's fabric was harvested and spun, and stitched and finished, etc. If there are two button downs and they're both made of cotton? I personally have the money to spend where I can spend a little more to make sure it hangs on my body better (though, I would not say that aritzia caters to my body type--most of the tops seem to expect a low bust/waist ratio). A more expensive button down might be more opaque and sturdier, the seams might be finished a little better.

I don't shop as much at all anymore, but I don't scoff at H&M due to quality issues--a $50 dollar button down from H&M might be an incredible button down. A $5 dollar pair of pleather leggings will be terrible. Not terribly surprising. I am not sure if H&M is good on labor practices though--and I think about those things a little more nowadays, not necessarily because I have money to spend enough to think about those things, but because I have enough clothes and can be choosy about if I add anything to my wardrobe (If I all of a sudden urgently needed several new outfits though? I wouldn't necessarily be as choosy).

\[eta: I personally didn't used to shop at Kohl's or TJ Maxx because I found the variety of styles (and quality, I suppose) to be overwhelming--too much looking for stuff that would actually suit me and feel good--I know what I am getting from other stores--brands have aesthetics I can rely on pretty easily.

They loved thrifting more than anything, and were already rather good looking and could find anything they wanted and look artlessly chic in them.

Meanwhile my peers who were on financial aid and were girls of color had parents who knew that if we weren't wearing brand new button downs (sometimes from target, sometimes my mom would take me to H&M! which was expensive for us! And fancy!) it would be harder for us to navigate the social scene. And it was, while one of my wealthy friends wearing scuffed shoes was seen as bohemian, another of my friends was talked to for not ""taking care of her appearance"". 

I know a lot of adult women who are still trapped in weird places that need to deal with this.

H&M,"Lol I actually *do* thrift shop because I have the time, and I have the disposable income now to spend on rather expensive things, but absolutely back when I was a broke college student with no time to do anything I definitely shopped at H&M. Yes, I had barely any savings. No, I didn't spend hours in a mall (because I hated shopping and also) because I knew how to quickly find what I needed and sometimes that meant blazers at H&M for some interview. I'm nowhere near the leisure class yet, but I grew up around enough wealth to know when people are trying to pin the blame on poor people when poor people aren't the problem. Hell even middle class people buying form shein aren't the problem in the ethics of clothing world, and if you can't see that, then tough.

eta: thrift shopping also is not a balm that addresses the moral ethics of extreme consumerism. Also the individual acquisition of clothing is *not* the problem when it comes to, if I understand you correctly, the exploitation of the labor class, the destruction of the environment by corporations, the greenwashing companies do, the blame the rich place excessively on the impoverished when it's clear that regulatory bodies are the ones needing to do all the work.

Also, we're on a sub that decries fast fashion in a long form post at least twice a month for the last 3 years. Sometimes those posts reek of classism, and sometimes those posts seem very earnest and useful.  

The problem here is that corporations have tricked people into thinking they can vote with their dollar, the problem is that even with thrifting as an option, there are problems in that cycle as well (I won't relink to the articles/studies I've already linked to). 

The problem is that no matter what the fuck I do, and I do all sorts of things **because** I can **afford** to, I know that **without proper regulation this is shit**. It's all shit. It's like yelling at someone for not composting. Like it's so good to compost, but we Maisie Silvermom in Hometown, Connecticut composting or not is not the problem---when we look at these things, we are distracted from looking at the real problem. The oil companies, the planes, the wealthiest billionaires with their personal jets going the fuck everywhere. 

The reason I pointed earlier out that time was a privilege of the leisure class, is because this specific argument you're making? The vote with your dollar, trickle down, grassroots argument, is *exactly* what the elites who own the oil companies, the fashion companies, have their fingers all about the zeitgeist, the billions of dollars are making. I've watched them craft these arguments!! It's their way of pretending that their decisions are not the problem, and if hoi polloi stopped shopping at H&M maybe then the world would change for the better and clothing labor would be fairer (as if they can't decide right now without *any* real loss to themselves), and clothing waste would be resolved (as if they can't fix that right now). 

The biggest impacts I can make (without violence) are not where I shop, but how I contribute to legislation. Sometimes that means protesting whatever, a lot of times that means I either throw my money at or try to help people who are lobbying for this stuff through campaigning or whatever. This is still stuff I can do *because I have the time and the privilege*, and I would never judge someone for their decisions to shop wherever. 

People deserve to be comfortable, poor people deserve to make choices that are convenient for them and not have those choices be scrutinized and judged for value impact. It is misplaced anger to think that they are the problem.",0.04476332199546486,0.4179280045351474,neutral

Uniqlo,"So here's my experience

I disagree that Nordstrom has to be that expensive, they do have sales and Nordstrom Rack. I've been shopping at Nordstrom for since I was a teen and going with my mom and grandma. They're a good department store--they have clothing for teens and adults and older adults. I think they also do a decent job at being aspirational but relatively attainable too.

Kohl's occasionally has decent items, but overall the design and quality isn't great for women's clothing. The textiles used don't feel as nice in the women's section. I think they're fine for men's clothes and will occasionally snag a men's sweater from clearance. But I'd sooner buy my cheap basics from Target or Uniqlo. 
I stopped shopping at H&M after college because there wasn't one near me and the sizing runs really small in the bust for my size. I was a size 8/10 and often wearing the largest size there which felt crappy so I stopped. It's for cheap, trendy clothes for smaller bodied people but it doesn't translate to the clothes I wear in my 30s. 
Walmart occasionally has some clothes that look good, and some have held up decently for the price but more often they're too trendy for my taste.",0.2388888888888889,0.49409722222222224,positive
Uniqlo,"I can't talk about why others recommend those stores but I can definitely say why I’m recommending them. First yes, I can afford those stores though I mostly shop on sales and rarely pay a full price in there. 

The more important reasons why I recommend stores like Aritzia or OtherStories or COS. 
1. they have more modern cut clothes. Like i’m in love with these [House of Dagmar ](https://www.houseofdagmar.com/us/valentina-flannel) trousers. I simply won't find anything similar in Target or Kohls period.
2. Target/Walmart are not that cheap. I love to shop at Target for home decor and cleaning supplies and at first made a great effort to explore their clothing section. My summary: tons of acrylics for not so cheap prices. $30 is a regular sweater price. I can buy a wool Uniqlo sweater for only $10 more. This summer I bought at Uniqlo gorgeous 50%cotton 50%silk sweater for $15. $15! Silk! Full price was $49. So most of the time it's just doesn't make sense to me to shop at Target.
3. Target/Walmart etc have a big variety but don't have an “identity” so to say. It's a vast ocean of clothes with different styles and qualities. To find something good is very much like thrifting when I need to put a lot of effort to go through a lot of clothes to find something I like. I do love some of my Target clothes for home lounging. Absolutely love this [hoodie sweater ](https://www.target.com/p/women-s-crewneck-hooded-pullover-sweater-a-new-day/-/A-83904169?preselect=82389002#lnk=sametab). 
4. Zara and H&M are harder cause they are the epitome of fast fashion. They cover a vast range of trends and change them in a heartbeat. There are great collections but they go and can be changed by something not so great. So it is just hard to keep up with everything and in turn, recommend. The sweater or pants I loved won't be there in a month and will never come back. I do look at H&M and Zara for cheaper options. Like the trousers above I found similar on Asos.",0.3067083333333333,0.5438099816849817,positive
Uniqlo,"I think for a lot of people, the first list of stores/brands you mentioned provide a good balance between design and quality, so that's why they're popular.  In the second list, the stores skew further to one direction than the other. For example, you can get trendy items at H&M, but with generally lower quality (e.g. there is a lot of polyester).  I've never shopped there, but I imagine Kohls is reasonably high quality, but less stylish.

I personally buy stuff at a variety of price points.  I aim to pay as little as I can to achieve the look and comfort that I'm after.  If I can get what I want at somewhere like Uniqlo, I will. If the cheaper stuff doesn't meet my needs, I'll look to more expensive brands.  Often your personal body shape (how *average* you are in different areas) will dictate where you can go cheap, and where you need to spend more.  For me, I only buy cheap t-shirts, I spend more on jeans, and jackets I usually either have made to measure, or have to pay a fair bit for alterations.",0.17923333333333336,0.5426,positive
Uniqlo,"More expensive brands are often (though definitely not only!) better quality. Though some brands have more ""ethical"" labor practices than others, I don't really think that that is what is going on at a store like Nordstrom. If people don't specify a budget, something pricier is typically going to be a better option than something cheaper in terms of fit, construction, fabric, etc, along with style. 

When people request a lower budget, I do see people recommend brands like Uniqlo, Zara, and H&M. I even see Old Navy and Target. The first three in particular are typically found in cities and tend to copy more current designer trends. Kohl's and Walmart are typically far more rural/more lower-middle class and working class suburbs. And whether people address it or not, I think there is some sizism and racial bias against brands associated mainly with Black people. This isn't to say that people here are racist or sizist but rather that there are some biases that shape what brands are seen as fashionable or not fashionable, e.g. I never see recommendations here for stores like Rainbow even though I don't think the labor practices are so different from say H&M. Difference is where the different stores are located and who they serve. Now many more companies are carrying larger sizes, but Uniqlo, Zara, and H&M are Japanese and European budget brands that only carry straight sizes (or at least that was the case historically). 

In terms of my own shopping practices, I rarely shop at stores like Nordstrom because the prices feel very inflated and brick and mortars rarely keep sale merchandise in stock. 10-15 years ago, department stores had the benefit of being somewhere you could go and try things on in-person, but that hasn't been my experience recently. Nowadays I save up for some more specialty small brands and then buy vintage and nicer brands secondhand. So while I am not sure a $300 dress is more worth it than a $50 one, but a secondhand version of the same thing for $80-100 often is worth it to me. Higher price doesn't necessarily mean good quality, but good quality comes at a higher cost if that makes sense.",0.16741666666666666,0.4776944444444446,positive

I like Aritzia because I know the exact items that suit my body type and I feel their tops, despite the obvious decline in quality, still have much better draping than your average item at say h&m. I do still shop at h&m occasionally but those are rarer occasions because I think the items tend to be less flattering.

I am also absolutely not sifting through garbage websites (walmart.ca no thank you).

The more I shop online the more I am going to rely on stores where I know what the fit is like, is consistent, has good return policies, people leave quality reviews, etc. Nordstrom has an amazing return policy in my experience.

And I agree with others that people providing advice and comments here are people who *actually enjoy fashion* and therefore will be more likely to spend more money on their clothes ergo they end up recommending higher-end places.

Unfortunately almost everything available in stores is basically fast fashion these days. And the ones that you pay more to shop at still don’t pay garment workers a fair wage or provide adequate workplace safety.

Following the Rana Plaza Collapse, Gap, among other retailers, specifically declined to engage in a contract with Bangladeshi unions to implement safety controls because it would be “too costly”. The plan would have been funded by company contributions of up to $500k per year.

So for me, sometimes that means spending 50 $/euro on a dress or shirt as opposed to 15 $/euro on a shirt.

But I go online and see people shitting all over it as cheap fast fashion. Cheap?!?!?! I honestly felt a little of the insult myself bc I like it a lot.

Zara is considered high-end fashion in my country. I remember those ""cool"" girls in high school flaunting basics from Zara only to personally find out the price and quality of fabric they use.

Zara,"Regardless the purchasing power of the currencies in different countries, Zara is fast fashion by definition. It is owned by fast fashion giant Inditex. The process of making a garment from start (design) to finish (being hang in a store) is incredibly fast, and the collections move fast too, with new items coming in the stores weekly, following the most current trends. The clothing is made by poorly paid workers in developing countries. It makes sense for it to be perceived as high-end in countries where Zara (and Mango, H&M, ecc) are expensive, and probably is one of the few options for trendy clothing. But it is correct to call it fast fashion, because it simply is.

Edit: Regarding the reputation, when I was in Italy it was considered by older women a cheaper alternative to boutique clothing for like formal clothes for work (think of a 50 year old bank worker buying a blazer). It probably would have been perceived differently by younger girls!

Zara,"Spaniard here, I guess I can give an insight as to the reputation of Zara in its own home nation.

As you can imagine, it is quite a reputable brandname in the sense that it is one of Spain's most widely internationalized companies. His founder, Amancio Ortega, is known for being the richest national individual. With these premises, of course, a plethora of opinions arise, varying from those people who celebrate the company and its founder as a case of major success for the country, to those who denounce the company for labour abuses in delocalized factories around the world and Ortega himself as a tax evader.

However, I think your question has to do more with the clothing side of things, and, in this sense, I feel like it would be categorized in the middle as far as reputation goes: it's certainly not the cheapest, but it is also the main go-to store for many middle income families. Indeed, it's like the brand tries to give an impression of high end fashion at an accessible cost for people in the spectrum (and I say it's ""like"", because they are known for not spending anything in marketing, like, they never announce themselves or anything because people do already know what Zara is). But, as I was saying, they are by no means at the higher end of the fashion side of things, for which wealthier people would usually go to places such as Cortefiel and Massimo Dutti (both of which I think are owned by Zara itself, by the way).

Nevertheless, I think I understand where your question comes from; an old foreign classmate of mine once told me that Zara is much pricier elsewhere in the world than in Spain, which I found to be really curious - like, would they purposefully keep prices lower in its own nation out of special consideration? I don't know, hard to say for me; I haven't really ever gone to a Zara abroad, and they're definitely not my go-to clothing shop anyways.

Zara,"The thing is, Zara really is inexpensive fast fashion but because we are so used to seeing crazy cheap fast fashion online brands everywhere and clothes are cheaper now than they EVER have been, it seems expensive by comparison. Which leads people to think it's can't be that bad, because it's much more costly than Shein and BooHoo et al, right? And it's a complex issue because many people that criticise these practices are branded elitists who want to take affordable options away from people on limited incomes. 

If you look back 500 years, clothes were so expensive that even rich people didn't have wardrobes like the average minimum wage person has today (purely in terms of number of outfits, not quality!). Over time clothes became cheaper as textile making became industrialised, the sewing machine was invented etc. In the 1930's a decent income for a man working full time in the US was about $30 a week. That would be something like a journalist or clerk, so many would have brought home much less. If you look at ads for clothes of the time, it was a much bigger proportion of that salary than we pay today for clothes. $10 would have been a typical amount to pay for a dress for example. 1/3 weekly salary for one garment is much more than the average person is willing to pay today.

So it's really our perspective on clothes that has changed. We aren't willing to spend what they should cost (in a fair responsible world) because society wants dirt cheap and practically disposable instead of high quality, long wearing and carefully purchased. Worth remembering that Zara is one of the fast fashion originators - previous to its rise fashion brands would release seasonal collections rather than fortnightly/weekly/daily releases like is done today.

I think Zara uses lower quality materials (like rayon, polyurethane), and the craftsmanship is of low quality. I agree with you that the styles can be unique and very cool, certainly taking inspiration from higher end items that cost much more. 

I would say H&M does this too - they have some styles clearly taken from designer fashion, and maybe they use better fabrics than Zara (organic cotton, etc) but in my experience their craftsmanship/finishing details are terrible, maybe worse than Zara. I've had items that had crooked sewing, a dress with a piece of the inner lining sewn into the front of the bodice on one side but not the other, seams and hems will be asymmetrical, etc. 

I can't speak for my entire country's opinion on the brand, but I think of them as *fashionable but not suitable for me*. If I buy something for $50, I want the item I get to be worthy of my $50. I don't want to pay $50 to be handed a $4 item.",0.021380952380952382,0.5808214285714285,mixed
Zara,"I'm from Russia. Too poor to buy bad clothes!

I really liked 2021 summer collection, but all models are made tall, and I'm 160 centimeters tall. In fact, in most outfit you will not look very good.

I think I will say something general about the entire mass market and fast fashion. Its quality is constantly lowed. 10 years ago, when I was a teenager, the things there were of high quality, and many of them are still on me: the softest cotton sweatshirts, great cut dresses and stuff like that. But over time, the quality of the cut and the production decreases, as they are transferred to poorest countries, where people receive pennies for their work and must follow cannibalistic produce standards.

Last year, a friend really liked one dress, translated into rubles, it cost about 90 dollars. $90 for loose threads and polyester! It's oo much for me! Perhaps it's the idiotic Russian marketing of big brands: it is believed that if you do not get 200% of the revenue, then this is a loss-making business. It’s very funny sometimes to peel off the Russian price tag and see the European one with a price of a two size less.

For the same or half+ price, you can find better natural fabric products on local brand. Of course, local brands have a different production method, their own style, collections do not change every two weeks and there are no fast trends. But I'm not a teenager anymore and I can climb into my mother's, stepmother's and grandmother's closet. Many things from there are 100% modern trends that do not need to be reworked, and have a premium quality and material for qurrent time.

Zara in Russia is clothing for last years university graduates, low-level office workers, kin on fashion but not rich or middle-class. Further, people prefer local brands, Massimo Dutti (also part of Zara's group), Benetton... I hope I managed to show an example direction.  
Zara is:  
\- better things are cheaper or same at M&S, Colin's, Uniqlo, Tom Tailor  
\- cheaper and about the same quality in Reserved, Cropp, befree  
\- their strong side is marketing and advertising, not clothes.

In terms of ""quality"" of clothing, it's possible that you might find something at the exact same cost that is just much better---it's also possible that you might comb through zara and find something really really really really good that is also just cheaper than the rest of their stuff.

Rather, they mean that you’re not getting what you pay for quality-wise, and especially if the relative cost of an item is that significant of a portion of someone’s paycheck. Put differently, the end product doesn’t justify the price of the item. The sewing tends to be poor and the construction slipshod, the fabric cheap, the details minimal, and the fit questionable unless a given item happens to work for your body. Of course, if you love an item anyway, the price might be justified to you regardless of what it’s technically worth.

When I am looking at a brand, I’m looking to see if the price matches the quality of the clothing. The style is one thing, but the quality, what fabric was used to create the clothing item matters even more.

Then was shocked how affordable it was and I remember my mom marvelling how they could offer such high quality at this price. It was 5x better than C&A which was the poor man's go to shop. Then Zara topped H&M with slightly better quality and higher prices. Then Mango and after COS. All of them essentially have a mix of good quality and poor quality items. It is just difficult to spot due to them having such a high amount of products available at the same time and the lines changing so quickly. 

All of them have horrendous working conditions in their factories. They have some neat programs to make us believe they care about their corporate responsibility but that's just smoke and mirrors. 
It is legitimate to say they have children's blood on their hands. Just google the sewing factory fires where workers were locked in the building and couldn't escape. Or the factory collapses or the chemical burn accidents. It happens still and it happens by far too ofte . Back in the 90s you would actually find a lot of items with some brownish blood stains inside. It was truly that bad and I don't doubt it still is, they just got better at quality control. 

Now I don't say to stay abstinent from fast fashion but maybe think twice before you buy something. I did this for a few years by leaving clothes in the shopping cart for a night and then check back later. Most of the time I didn't want or need the item anymore. Then I would put the money into a separate savings account instead and saved up for a high quality fashion spree.

I also bought some summer dresses from Zara, which usually just lasted one year or two. Usually after sometime, if I look at them in the wardrobe, I don’t feel like wearing them again. So it is indeed a fast fashion brand.

Zara,"I think H&M has a very different feel from Zara, though, at least in developing countries like India. Zara stores are monochromatic, airy, almost premium feeling spaces. The clothes, even if they aren't well-made, include some classic styles and often use heavier, stiffer fabrics.

H&M, on the other hand, is just one step above Forever 21. If only high schoolers wear F21, only college students wear H&M. Trendy clothes in the usual stretchy, thin material and very forgettable stores. You'll rarely find anything that costs more than 2500 rs (about 25 USD, but significantly more if you account for PPP differences), while anything from ZARA that isn't a super basic tee is more than 2000 rs, going up to 5 or 6k for the more unique pieces.

Neither is accessible to the vast majority of the population, of course. The wealthy wear high quality clothes like they do everywhere else in the world, but the upper middle class (the top 5% or even less) are quite enamoured with foreign fast fashion brands.

I don’t expect to see French seams in most garments for example and I don’t want to because they’re not strong enough for most clothing. So your last comment doesn’t really make sense to me. Serged seams are likely best on 99% of clothes? Also with respect to loose threads, obviously it is a result of lazy workmanship but you can usually snip them - they are harmless.

But otherwise yeah I agree, there are other ways to tell something is poorly made and/or won’t last: mostly synthetic fibres, irregular weave in the fabric (look for defects in the weave of the cloth), hems have not been pressed properly (I see this at Zara a lot - the manufacturer didn’t press down the hem on a shirt collar for example before stitching it so it’s warped beneath the stitch), misaligned joints or tiny holes especially in the armpit of shirts",0.07191061253561254,0.4739494301994302,neutral

Pretty much my entire Instagram reel is ""What's new in Zara"", and they just absolutely dominate the algorithm. 

What's more the website design is intended for doom scrolling, rather than straightforward, efficient navigation. Perfect for the 21st century social media-affected lifestyle. Massimo Dutti's website is very similar.

As a child, my mum only ever took me into Zara once in a blue moon (the Zara aesthetic doesn't match her dress sense whatsoever), and I never went in by myself because it was far too expensive and grown up for me, so Zara had this exclusive air of mystery about it. Now that I *am* Zara's target market and my fashion tastes align more closely to Zara's aesthetic AND I can actually afford to shop there at last, I've got a much better idea of what Zara does offer.

One thing I have noticed is that the materials Zara use for their blazers, trousers, skirts etc. are really thick and heavy, which I don't see stores like H&M doing. That's more Reiss, Hobbs etc.'s territory. Really my problem with Zara is the quality of the construction (buttons falling off, dodgy seam stitching, glass gemstones that have popped off/not been glued very well, fringe-y bits having been yanked out), and the fact that broken items seem to get put back on the shelves without a care in the world. I'm not sure whether that's a factory quality control problem, a staffing problem (maybe they don't have time to check the garments over and are too overworked) or whether that's a customer problem where customers are breaking things in the changing rooms and not being honest about it when they put it back.

I think Zara uses lower quality materials (like rayon, polyurethane), and the craftsmanship is of low quality. I agree with you that the styles can be unique and very cool, certainly taking inspiration from higher end items that cost much more. 

I would say H&M does this too - they have some styles clearly taken from designer fashion, and maybe they use better fabrics than Zara (organic cotton, etc) but in my experience their craftsmanship/finishing details are terrible, maybe worse than Zara. I've had items that had crooked sewing, a dress with a piece of the inner lining sewn into the front of the bodice on one side but not the other, seams and hems will be asymmetrical, etc. 

I can't speak for my entire country's opinion on the brand, but I think of them as *fashionable but not suitable for me*. If I buy something for $50, I want the item I get to be worthy of my $50. I don't want to pay $50 to be handed a $4 item.",0.021380952380952382,0.5808214285714285,mixed
H&M,"I'm from Russia. Too poor to buy bad clothes!

I really liked 2021 summer collection, but all models are made tall, and I'm 160 centimeters tall. In fact, in most outfit you will not look very good.

I think I will say something general about the entire mass market and fast fashion. Its quality is constantly lowed. 10 years ago, when I was a teenager, the things there were of high quality, and many of them are still on me: the softest cotton sweatshirts, great cut dresses and stuff like that. But over time, the quality of the cut and the production decreases, as they are transferred to poorest countries, where people receive pennies for their work and must follow cannibalistic produce standards.

Last year, a friend really liked one dress, translated into rubles, it cost about 90 dollars. $90 for loose threads and polyester! It's oo much for me! Perhaps it's the idiotic Russian marketing of big brands: it is believed that if you do not get 200% of the revenue, then this is a loss-making business. It’s very funny sometimes to peel off the Russian price tag and see the European one with a price of a two size less.

For the same or half+ price, you can find better natural fabric products on local brand. Of course, local brands have a different production method, their own style, collections do not change every two weeks and there are no fast trends. But I'm not a teenager anymore and I can climb into my mother's, stepmother's and grandmother's closet. Many things from there are 100% modern trends that do not need to be reworked, and have a premium quality and material for qurrent time.

Zara in Russia is clothing for last years university graduates, low-level office workers, kin on fashion but not rich or middle-class. Further, people prefer local brands, Massimo Dutti (also part of Zara's group), Benetton... I hope I managed to show an example direction.  
Zara is:  
\- better things are cheaper or same at M&S, Colin's, Uniqlo, Tom Tailor  
\- cheaper and about the same quality in Reserved, Cropp, befree  
\- their strong side is marketing and advertising, not clothes.  
\- is still better in quality and more interesting than cloths fom H&M))

I hope my answer was of some useful for you.

From Turkish brands, I love Mavi jeans, they fit my figure perfectly. Please could you tell what is their reputation in Turkey?",0.17039358974358976,0.4404512820512821,positive

So while it is not ""cheap"" like Shein-cheap or Discounter-cheap it is priced so that every teenager can (and will) buy most of their clothes there. It is priced similar to h&m. 

However it is also classified as cheap here partly because of the price tag but mostly because of the quality of their garments. Since I love thrifting, I see an awful lot of zara clothes and each time I am disappointed if the piece is Zara for the following reasons: while some of the pieces look amazing,  usually the quality is really bad - they rarely use natural fibers and polyester or acryl (pure or blends) instead which I hate and will not buy, for environmental and personal reasons. And the quality is usually pretty bad. I like to look at the inside of an garment to see how well it is constructed and with Zara pieced usually they have very simple and bad constructed pieces with loose Strings and just simple (and cheap) serged seams.",-0.0665054945054945,0.5776263736263736,mixed

Norway - low quality, cheap, but trendy because they only had stores in Oslo

H&M,"Expensive can still be fast fashion! Fast fashion is just what's the turnaround time for making the clothes (and nowadays there's a high correlation between that turnaround time and bad labor practices and also bad clothing workmanship). As a kid I certainly thought Zara was high end simply because I couldn't afford it. Then learning more about the company and how they made clothes etc. it seemed like it was maybe slightly better, but much more marked up H&M. But even then H&M didn't seem all that ""cheap"" to me--it just seemed like it was fast fashion.

I have been happy to buy things from Zara if it's on sale, and those things have lasted for some time (but then again, so has my H&M stuff--some pieces are going on over 10 years). But some pieces look so good when I'm browsing through the store and I touch them and they feel really aaaaaa against my hands, in a way that other less expensive polyester things feel and then it's hard to want to bring myself to spend *that* much money on something that's made of a fabric that I'll be super uncomfortable in (*some* polyester makes me sweat in excess).

In terms of ""quality"" of clothing, it's possible that you might find something at the exact same cost that is just much better---it's also possible that you might comb through zara and find something really really really really good that is also just cheaper than the rest of their stuff.

The zara aesthetic is nice, but the aesthetic is what costs the money.

When I am looking at a brand, I’m looking to see if the price matches the quality of the clothing. The style is one thing, but the quality, what fabric was used to create the clothing item matters even more.

TL:DR Look at what fabric they are using to create their clothing. If the shirt is $75, but on the clothing tag it says it’s made with Polyester, I would not even buy it, it’s a ripe off.

Then was shocked how affordable it was and I remember my mom marvelling how they could offer such high quality at this price. It was 5x better than C&A which was the poor man's go to shop. Then Zara topped H&M with slightly better quality and higher prices. Then Mango and after COS. All of them essentially have a mix of good quality and poor quality items. It is just difficult to spot due to them having such a high amount of products available at the same time and the lines changing so quickly. 

All of them have horrendous working conditions in their factories. They have some neat programs to make us believe they care about their corporate responsibility but that's just smoke and mirrors. 
It is legitimate to say they have children's blood on their hands. Just google the sewing factory fires where workers were locked in the building and couldn't escape. Or the factory collapses or the chemical burn accidents. It happens still and it happens by far too ofte . Back in the 90s you would actually find a lot of items with some brownish blood stains inside. It was truly that bad and I don't doubt it still is, they just got better at quality control. 

Now I don't say to stay abstinent from fast fashion but maybe think twice before you buy something. I did this for a few years by leaving clothes in the shopping cart for a night and then check back later. Most of the time I didn't want or need the item anymore. Then I would put the money into a separate savings account instead and saved up for a high quality fashion spree.

H&M, on the other hand, is just one step above Forever 21. If only high schoolers wear F21, only college students wear H&M. Trendy clothes in the usual stretchy, thin material and very forgettable stores. You'll rarely find anything that costs more than 2500 rs (about 25 USD, but significantly more if you account for PPP differences), while anything from ZARA that isn't a super basic tee is more than 2000 rs, going up to 5 or 6k for the more unique pieces.

As a child, my mum only ever took me into Zara once in a blue moon (the Zara aesthetic doesn't match her dress sense whatsoever), and I never went in by myself because it was far too expensive and grown up for me, so Zara had this exclusive air of mystery about it. Now that I *am* Zara's target market and my fashion tastes align more closely to Zara's aesthetic AND I can actually afford to shop there at last, I've got a much better idea of what Zara does offer.

One thing I have noticed is that the materials Zara use for their blazers, trousers, skirts etc. are really thick and heavy, which I don't see stores like H&M doing. That's more Reiss, Hobbs etc.'s territory. Really my problem with Zara is the quality of the construction (buttons falling off, dodgy seam stitching, glass gemstones that have popped off/not been glued very well, fringe-y bits having been yanked out), and the fact that broken items seem to get put back on the shelves without a care in the world. I'm not sure whether that's a factory quality control problem, a staffing problem (maybe they don't have time to check the garments over and are too overworked) or whether that's a customer problem where customers are breaking things in the changing rooms and not being honest about it when they put it back.

But I'm not a teenager anymore and I can climb into my mother's, stepmother's and grandmother's closet. Many things from there are 100% modern trends that do not need to be reworked, and have a premium quality and material for qurrent time.

Zara in Russia is clothing for last years university graduates, low-level office workers, kin on fashion but not rich or middle-class. Further, people prefer local brands, Massimo Dutti (also part of Zara's group), Benetton... I hope I managed to show an example direction.  
Zara is:  
\- better things are cheaper or same at M&S, Colin's, Uniqlo, Tom Tailor  
\- cheaper and about the same quality in Reserved, Cropp, befree  
\- their strong side is marketing and advertising, not clothes.  
\- is still better in quality and more interesting than cloths fom H&M))

I hope my answer was of some useful for you.

From Turkish brands, I love Mavi jeans, they fit my figure perfectly. Please could you tell what is their reputation in Turkey?",0.17039358974358976,0.4404512820512821,positive
Uniqlo,"It was marketed here in Australia at first as being a “European” brand so we thought it was fancy, and a lot of the pieces look amazing so we all threw our money at it.

Zara has some really good basic things, their jeans and t-shirts are better quality than H&M, personally I always buy my jeans there. But I would never ever buy a winter coat in Zara! When it comes to wool sweaters and coats, Zara is very overpriced for their quality. That’s why I buy wool sweaters in Uniqlo and I buy wool coats from smaller local brands where I can get a 80% wool coat for like 180-200 dollars.

Mango,"Regardless the purchasing power of the currencies in different countries, Zara is fast fashion by definition. It is owned by fast fashion giant Inditex. The process of making a garment from start (design) to finish (being hang in a store) is incredibly fast, and the collections move fast too, with new items coming in the stores weekly, following the most current trends. The clothing is made by poorly paid workers in developing countries. It makes sense for it to be perceived as high-end in countries where Zara (and Mango, H&M, ecc) are expensive, and probably is one of the few options for trendy clothing. But it is correct to call it fast fashion, because it simply is.

Edit: Regarding the reputation, when I was in Italy it was considered by older women a cheaper alternative to boutique clothing for like formal clothes for work (think of a 50 year old bank worker buying a blazer). It probably would have been perceived differently by younger girls!
In the Netherlands it was the most trendy store, with huge lines outside it during sale season. It didn't seem to be considered too expensive by most girls I knew, since lots of them shopped there. 
I personally always found it over priced for what it is.",0.11165501165501167,0.5036546786546787,positive
Mango,"When H&M launched in Germany I was around 14 and I thought it was a high end fashion brand. Then was shocked how affordable it was and I remember my mom marvelling how they could offer such high quality at this price. It was 5x better than C&A which was the poor man's go to shop. Then Zara topped H&M with slightly better quality and higher prices. Then Mango and after COS. All of them essentially have a mix of good quality and poor quality items. It is just difficult to spot due to them having such a high amount of products available at the same time and the lines changing so quickly. 

All of them have horrendous working conditions in their factories. They have some neat programs to make us believe they care about their corporate responsibility but that's just smoke and mirrors. 
It is legitimate to say they have children's blood on their hands. Just google the sewing factory fires where workers were locked in the building and couldn't escape. Or the factory collapses or the chemical burn accidents. It happens still and it happens by far too ofte . Back in the 90s you would actually find a lot of items with some brownish blood stains inside. It was truly that bad and I don't doubt it still is, they just got better at quality control. 

Now I don't say to stay abstinent from fast fashion but maybe think twice before you buy something. I did this for a few years by leaving clothes in the shopping cart for a night and then check back later. Most of the time I didn't want or need the item anymore. Then I would put the money into a separate savings account instead and saved up for a high quality fashion spree. 

Nowadays It is actually quite rare that I need anything new and if I do, I'd still rather spend 10 - 20% of my net income on a good item or save up for a full outfit. If it is high quality, I know I can wear it over years to come.",0.08769451269451271,0.44787059787059785,neutral

Uniqlo,"A review of all the leggings I own - Alo Yoga, Nike, Outdoor Voices, Girlfriend Collective, Lululemon, Uniqlo",0.6,1.0,positive
Uniqlo,"[imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/CXGVVtu)

Since I have been at home I have been doing a lot of zoom yoga classes, and have been wanting to update my athletics wardrobe. I do have several Nike Pro 5"" shorts from my college varsity athletics days, but my leggings game was quite weak (I didn't really care about leggings as much because the type of training I did didn't require it). 

A little about me: I am 5'10, my weight fluctuates between 185 lb to 215 lb. At my current weight of 209 lb, my 'loose' measurements are 43""-35""-45"" and my 'fitted' measurements are 41”-32”-43”. All of these leggings are in a size Large with the exception of the Lululemon shorts which are a size 12 and the Uniqlo which are XL. I wash all my leggings on cold and air dry them. I look for a good fit in the waist (which is tough bc of my large hip/waist ratio) as well as high compression and flexibility. Softness is a plus but not necessarily a priority. 

* Nike Sculpt Legging - 80% nylon / 20% elastane. I bought these back in 2015 when I started to get more serious about my athletic training in college. These are my FAVORITE because they are high waisted, thick performance material with high compression, opaque, they don't slide down my hips nor do they bag at the knees, and are the most reliable pair of longer athletic pants I own. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ2tW-VV_-c) shows the full length version of the legging from 2015 but the model in the video is wearing a few sizes too large probably, so it looks baggy and unflattering on her. Anyway, these leggings are my gold standard and I have not found a pair that fits me better. I used to own these in the full length version, but lost them on a trip. I was devastated. But thankfully I still have the Capri version, and I take them with me when I go to a physical store to buy leggings just to have something to compare to. NOTE: I can’t find these online anymore, they only have [Nike Sculpt Lux](https://www.nike.com/t/sculpt-luxe-womens-7-8-tights-nW2Sp6) which look different and I can’t speak to the quality and fit of those. NOTE2: if you don’t enjoy compression/if you care about ~softness of the fabric, these are probably not the best for you. Comparably, these are “more difficult” to put on than the rest, but once they’re on they’re the only ones that consistently stay up.
* Alo Yoga Lounge Legging - 87% polyester / 13% spandex. These are a recent eBay acquisition. They are very soft - about as soft as the Lululemon Align 4"" shorts I have, but they are definitely thicker. Despite the thick-feeling material, they show underwear lines the most out of all the leggings I own (most likely because of light color). They feel the most like an organic cotton material out of all the leggings I own. They do fit ok at the waist (could be tighter), but they bag at the knees a bit for me and are too long on me. I am 5'10 but as you can tell from the photos my length comes from my torso rather than my legs. Their compression is minimal, however the waist is a bit tighter than my Outdoor Voices leggings (which have more compression throughout but the waistband is too loose). I wouldn't pay full price for these but they are nice as a legging to lounge in, and even fall asleep in. 
* Uniqlo Airism Soft Legging - 72% polyester / 28% spandex. I bought these on a whim one time at the mall and kind of regret it. They were only $20 so it's not a big loss, but I never wear them unless I have run out of clothes and need to wear something while I am doing laundry. Despite having the most spandex content of all my leggings, these seem to stretch the least. They slide down my hips and bag at the knees. These are self described to be ""dry"" and ""cool to the touch"" which I suppose I can agree with, but I have never worked out in these.
* Girlfriend Collective - 79% RPET (recycled polyester made out of plastic) / ??. I have washed these too many times since I received them in 2017 during their 'free leggings, just pay $20 shipping' promo launch so I don't know the exact fabric content of these leggings because it has rubbed off the label. In college these + the Nikes were the only long spandex I owned, so I wore the shit out of them. I hated that they slide down constantly/bag in the knees, but I didn't have enough time or energy to devote to finding a better pair at the time. These had compression, but didn't feel like I could do athletic activities in them which is such an oxymoron because the Nikes had *more* compression but still felt flexible. They have a tiny waistband pocket in the back that I have never used. They feel similar in texture to the Uniqlos, but are a bit softer. I would not pay full price for these (although someone told me that the new ones are better than the 2017 promo ones)
* Outdoor Voices 7/8 Freeform Legging - 85% polyester / 15% spandex. These feel similar in texture to the Alo Yoga leggings but the Alo are softer. They are described online as being ""peachy-soft"". Thickness wise they are between Alo (thick) and Lulu aligns (thin). I got this with the freeform bra in one of their student OV sets just to try out the brand. These leggings are soft and opaque, the waistband is seamless (not sure if this makes a difference) but way too flexible. I wore this set to zoom yoga and found myself constantly pulling the leggings up and having one of my boobs fall out of the freeform bra because it was so low cut (I ended up exchanging the bra from L for an XL to eliminate that issue). I'm thinking of going to the tailor and having them fix the waistband for me after covid19 is over. 
* Lululemon Align 4"" short - 81% nylon / 19% lycra elastane. Despite being the most similar in fabric content to the Nike sculpt leggings I own, these are one of the bottoms that have the least compression. The material is advertised as being for yoga which I can agree with. I got these a year ago and they have like the tiniest pilling throughout the inside of the shorts but it's not noticeable unless you're really looking for things to point out (as I am). I enjoy these for yoga, however I find they ride up a lot and the light color shows underwear lines. This and the OV are the only ones I have with a “seamless” waistband. Again I’m not sure if that makes a difference/how being seamless affects the fit.

I dislike OV leggings - ones I have compression to the point of restricting and does not flatter me (also fall down a lot). I also own Uniqlo in XL and it strangely feels too big for me - always slides down and no compression. I also used to own Old Navy built in sculpt- they were fine for me for a while, then ripped on the inside of the thigh, when I ordered another one to replace my old pair they were completely see through, so I gave up on repurchasing.

Uniqlo,"Ok i absolutely agree with you on the uniqlo airism tights, theyre restrictive and uncomfortable.  They almost feel like they are made for someone who needs no stretch for hips and butt. I hated them as soon as i attempted to grt them over my thighs.

But hear me out, the uniqlo heattech thin leggings are the most comfortable solid black leggings ever.  I am super picky about my leggings because A) my midsection is long so many leggings that advertise high waisted just cut me off wrong, and B) i have some awful issues with bladder and digestion so i need absolutely no compression but also enough spandex to still look nice. 

The only issue i have is the stitching up the inside of the legs became a bit messy after the dryer but its a small price to pay.  I own 5 or 6 pairs in black and grey and they are so comfy and look great.

Uniqlo,"My biggest concern when buying leggings is the size. It is always hard to find the perfect size for me as I am extremely petite. I'm 5'0 and have a 24 inch waist. I actually had a different experience with the Uniqlo AIRism legging compared to other people. It's often hard for me to find leggings small enough for me, so I was overjoyed when I found that Uniqlo sold an XS small enough for me. The legging has a high waist band that covers just above my belly button which I like. The waistband is also smaller than the rest of the legging, which I could see bother some people, but was great for me as it never slides down. I usually don't wear leggings to do ""high sweat"" workouts as my leggings get hot and sweaty, but with these leggings I always feel dry and cool! My only issue with these it does show your panty line, but if you smother your underwear smooth enough, it won't be visible. I think these leggings are great for price (only 20$) and I especially recommend them if you have a smaller, shorter body like me!",0.078640873015873,0.5813293650793651,mixed

Gap,"I've practiced yoga for almost 10 years now and I'm also a runner (for longer than that). I practice power yoga and run distance so I need leggings that cater to these activities. I have various leggings from different brands but I admit I haven't bought any of Old Navy, Gap,...or that range in price for a looong time so have no opinion on them. Here are my fave leggings in order of preference:

1. Lululemon: I've been a long time customer of Lulu's, nearly 15 years. Overall to me they make the best leggings for various activities. I love the Align's for yoga and I wear Fast and Free's for running. In the winter I wear their tech fleece tights to run (i run outside). I have many pairs of their classic Wunder Unders too that I used to wear for lifting and general training.  Another reason I like Lulu is their lifetime warranty. They have fixed stitching on one of my hoodies that over 10 years old recently.
2. Teeki: I adore their leggings for yoga and especially hot yoga. They feel amazing on and are sweat proof and UV protective.
3. Karma Athletics: These guys make really nicely thick leggings that work well for running (as in they do not slide) and for yoga. They are a bit spongey feeling but in a good way. They have a lot of fun patterns too and bonus (at least for me) they are Canadian.
4. Alo Yoga: I think Alo are over priced for what they have. I only like their Goddess leggings and only for yoga. 
5. Ice Breaker: I love these guys leggings for winter running. I wear them as base layer when running below -10C. Their quality is great and they last a long time.
6. Sweaty Betty: I only have two leggings from them that I bought in the UK 5 years ago. They are reversible and work great for running or yoga. They were pricier than even the more expensive Lululemon leggings but if I had access to Sweaty Better here in Canada I would buy more",0.18693693693693694,0.5164414414414413,positive
Gap,"I also think my Nike leggings are my favorite(I think they might be the Nike Filament). I use mine for running and the capris don't budge at the knee of waist. I don't like their compression pants as well because they tend to fall down at the waist bit while running and don't have a pocket for my keys, but they are pretty comfy for pilates.

Gap,"Their powersoft fabric is very comfortable but it gives me cameltoe, since the fabric is really thin. It’s not noticeable for me in the black color thought. 

Their yoga leggings/majority cotton blend ones also give me bad cameltoe. I haven’t tried a dark pair to see if it’s less noticeable though. 

Their elevate leggings don’t really give me cameltoe! They’re all comfortable, with a good amount of compression, and a thicker fabric compared to powersoft. 

I will say tho that the leggings at Gap don’t give me a cameltoe. And they’re gusseted like all the old navy ones. The fabric of the gap leggings I own are also similar to the powersoft ones, so I guess they just make their crotches better? 

Overall I’m puzzled as to why old navy gives me cameltoe. I’m a little underweight, so I don’t have extra room there. Maybe I just have a weirdly shaped crotch 😂",0.049953703703703715,0.49537037037037046,neutral

Zara,"I can, but why should I, given that they're made of identical cloth woven on the same looms in the same mills and sewn by the same garment workers who make the 10 dollar basic tees?

I used to happily buy higher-end garments, especially second-hand when I was a broke grad student. But there used to be a clear difference in quality that meant they lasted for years (decades, in some cases). But half the time I see no difference at all between Holts and Zara.",0.09166666666666667,0.38125,neutral
Zara,"I think there is a clear material difference between clothes in the 50-200 range and the 1000-2000 range, but less clear between the 1000+ and 5000+ range, or between the 500 and 1000-2000 range.

The design and materials used are clearly different for Zara/Gap and Celine; even between Zara and mid range brands like Isabel Marant, there is a clear difference. For people who don't care for brands or showing off, sometimes the design is very important.

IE. Different blazers are shaped differently. There are ones that are designed to emphasize your shoulders, or ones that have a different draping for your torso. So, some people pay more for the design and drape. And of course, at a higher price level, the blazer will be made of wool/silk. Color is also important. There are thousands of renditions of the prince of wales check (Zara alone has done 100 different check patterns in the last year or so), but only a few brands in the past two years have done very good color combos/patterns of that particular check.

Also, at risk of being downvoted, I do believe there is a difference between mid range ""ethical"" brands and regular US mall brands. Everlane is not Gap, and the quality/design of materials does show. The style/quality of Everlane leather/silk/cashmere, at that price point, is better than Gap, J Crew, etc.

But if you wanna distinguish the 1000 Celine item and the 5000 Chanel item, then that is hard. All it comes down to is people's recognition of designer shapes, styles. People who own that really minimalist Fendi bag will be recognized by other people who have the same bag or have paid attention to the catalogues.

And for the really rich, sometimes it's not even about the $$$. I will never be able to afford it, but I saw the Chanel runway pics for S/S, and some of the items look like works of art. I'd love to wear something like that to a glitzy ball - until I realized that I don't do balls --don't even go to NYE parties at friends' homes, lol. But I see why people drop that kind of money for designer brands.

I personally don't like ostentatious display of wealth - I see that YSL bag everywhere and feel that girls are wearing that bag not for the style of the bag, but just for these monograms. But, there are people who pay for that kind of stuff, and I try not to judge them for it, because people do have different priorities.

For someone who wasn't quite so well-off 3 years ago ""affordable"" is Forever21 and H&M on a discount because going there for $50 can net you 3-4 items, maybe even 5. Go to Uniqlo with $50 and you're lucky to walk out of there with more than 2 items.

Uniqlo,"I thought some of y'all would be interested in this article about [Uniqlo](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/uniqlo-millennials-gap/583219/) in the Atlantic. It seems like Uniqlo is a frequent recommendation that many of us either love or hate. This article states what many of us already know—millennials can't afford luxury clothing but they want to look put together and professional in a wardrobe that will allow them to be upwardly mobile. ""Classic"" and ""timeless"" basics are the new signifiers of upper-middle-class wealth and professionalism (think Everlane and Theory). Uniqlo can emulate that style, bolstered by Americans' obsession with simple Japanese design. 

&#x200B;

A quote that I think sums up the article well: ""The question Uniqlo faces now is whether it can inherit the Gap’s empire without repeating its mistakes. To do so, it will have to convince shoppers across the country of a proposition that’s radical for the industry: Fashion can be affordable without being disposable.""

I always *think* I am going to like Uniqlo, then I find the fit too long and narrow, the fabric too itchy or stretchy, the construction lacking.

There is definitely a sizing difference between Uniqlo in Japan vs Uniqlo in other countries. I bought a shirt in S in Japan that fit me to a T, it was beautiful.

On the other hand I've also had items that were too tight in the waist or under the arms.

While I like that they use natural fabrics (cotton/linen/wool etc.) the quality of said fabrics isn't great. Their ""fine"" merino sweaters are so fine as to be transparent. All of their linen is oversized on me.  But stuff like their ultra light compact down is so worth it.

Their diffusers are extremely popular, as are the scented oils. 

Their travel related products are very nice too. I like their neck pillow a lot, many compare away luggage to the cheaper muji suitcase, and the hanging bathroom bag is pretty nice. They sell a lot of reusable clear bottles and containers that are also great for travel.  I’ve used some of their pouches for storing wires and hard drives for travel.

Uniqlo,"Learn to quit *what*? While I'm ahead of *what*, exactly? Am I not allowed to express my opinion because it's different than yours? 

I'll be very clear for you: 

1. In Japan, people don't like to stick out. Individuality isn't respected.
2. Fashion follows that. I know Japan is famous for being fashion forward but most people wear black, beige, gray, navy, white. Very basic, very neutral, very simple. 
3. Walking around in Tokyo, everyone looks the same. There is hardly any individuality or originality in the daily fashion choices of the majority of the people here. People shop at Uniqlo, GU, and Muji.
4. The world doesn't revolve around America. Fashion opinions reflect the contexts. My context is Japan. My opinion is from living here, not being American or living in America.
5. From here, Uniqlo is literally made for the masses to fit into Japanese society. I stand behind my assertions above.
6. In North America, people express themselves with fashion more than Japan. Your Uniqlo items might be more unique in America, I don't really know, nor do I care.
7. At my height, I can barely shop at Uniqlo. That's great they make sizes for American bodies, but in Japan that's not the case. Why would I like a shop I can't even shop at?

I'm not actually trying to insult you and I'm not sure why you're taking my opinion so personally. The world is vast, and without variety things would truly be boring. Here, it's cookie-cutter fashion, and that includes Uniqlo. 

> I feel like Uniqlo is made for people who don’t want to use one single brain cell on anything fashion related.

For someone who wasn't quite so well-off 3 years ago ""affordable"" is Forever21 and H&M on a discount because going there for $50 can net you 3-4 items, maybe even 5. Go to Uniqlo with $50 and you're lucky to walk out of there with more than 2 items.

It seems like Uniqlo is a frequent recommendation that many of us either love or hate. This article states what many of us already know—millennials can't afford luxury clothing but they want to look put together and professional in a wardrobe that will allow them to be upwardly mobile. ""Classic"" and ""timeless"" basics are the new signifiers of upper-middle-class wealth and professionalism (think Everlane and Theory). Uniqlo can emulate that style, bolstered by Americans' obsession with simple Japanese design.

There is definitely a sizing difference between Uniqlo in Japan vs Uniqlo in other countries. I bought a shirt in S in Japan that fit me to a T, it was beautiful. Order the same style/colour in Australia and it was baggy and long. All their tops are too long on me, but I'm used to that with everything I wear. On the other hand I've also had items that were too tight in the waist or under the arms.

While I like that they use natural fabrics (cotton/linen/wool etc.) the quality of said fabrics isn't great. Their ""fine"" merino sweaters are so fine as to be transparent. All of their linen is oversized on me.  But stuff like their ultra light compact down is so worth it.

They are definitely being more conscious about their inventory (which is basically the reason why so many of these companies go under—they are over-inventoried) and should then be able to pivot to suit the market’s needs. Massive companies like the GAP group took way too long to try to adjust to the new landscape and were stubborn about making changes.",0.1387310606060606,0.46851325757575757,positive
Gap,"I think there is a clear material difference between clothes in the 50-200 range and the 1000-2000 range, but less clear between the 1000+ and 5000+ range, or between the 500 and 1000-2000 range.

The design and materials used are clearly different for Zara/Gap and Celine; even between Zara and mid range brands like Isabel Marant, there is a clear difference. For people who don't care for brands or showing off, sometimes the design is very important.

IE. Different blazers are shaped differently. There are ones that are designed to emphasize your shoulders, or ones that have a different draping for your torso. So, some people pay more for the design and drape. And of course, at a higher price level, the blazer will be made of wool/silk. Color is also important. There are thousands of renditions of the prince of wales check (Zara alone has done 100 different check patterns in the last year or so), but only a few brands in the past two years have done very good color combos/patterns of that particular check.

Also, at risk of being downvoted, I do believe there is a difference between mid range ""ethical"" brands and regular US mall brands. Everlane is not Gap, and the quality/design of materials does show. The style/quality of Everlane leather/silk/cashmere, at that price point, is better than Gap, J Crew, etc.

But if you wanna distinguish the 1000 Celine item and the 5000 Chanel item, then that is hard. All it comes down to is people's recognition of designer shapes, styles. People who own that really minimalist Fendi bag will be recognized by other people who have the same bag or have paid attention to the catalogues.

And for the really rich, sometimes it's not even about the $$$. I will never be able to afford it, but I saw the Chanel runway pics for S/S, and some of the items look like works of art. I'd love to wear something like that to a glitzy ball - until I realized that I don't do balls --don't even go to NYE parties at friends' homes, lol. But I see why people drop that kind of money for designer brands.

I personally don't like ostentatious display of wealth - I see that YSL bag everywhere and feel that girls are wearing that bag not for the style of the bag, but just for these monograms. But, there are people who pay for that kind of stuff, and I try not to judge them for it, because people do have different priorities.

Zara,"If you can imagine IKEA launching a premium subsidiary brand, that also happened to sell clothes, that would be Arket. Really out of all of those brands, it's Arket that does minimalism properly. They don't go crazy with silhouettes or venture much into ""luxury"" looks, they primarily make things that are for everyday wear (and they like to colour block as well).

Which elements of Massimo Dutti do you like? Speaking as somebody who has been shopping in Massimo Dutti a lot lately, in my opinion they're a bit ""split personality"" design-wise, because sometimes they're just as guilty as COS at doing oversized silhouettes that are meant to give off a ""high fashion"" vibe, but actually if you were to dress like that in the street, it would be obvious that you were trying too hard. But then other times, they do much more clean and ""elegant"" stuff, or they try to release things with interesting details/fastenings or shaping that I've not seen anywhere else. So knowing what your preferences are within the brand would be helpful.

One last thing, have you looked at Zara's premium lines on their website? Both Zara and Massimo Dutti are part of the Inditex Group, so there'll probably be a lot of crossover between those two, especially as Zara's premium lines are at more or less an identical price point to Massimo Dutti.",0.05444444444444444,0.4995238095238094,neutral

I really enjoy Arket (though their shipping process to Canada can be a nightmare). They offer a minimalist style items that I appreciate.

I don't want to come across as someone trying to prove their knowledge of ""fashion."" I'm simply looking for unique and stylish everyday wear. The only issue with Massimo Dutti is that sometimes it feels like they're recycling the same items from season to season. Lol

H&M,"They're all at different price points, branding, and store concepts, so they all appeal to different people. I think the quality and price range is more than ""slightly"" different, except for some items in the H&M Premium Selection line. A top at full price at H&M is about USD $20-$50 right? vs. a top at Cos for USD $90-$150 or so? That's quite a difference in what customers are willing to spend on one item.

I wouldn't go so far as to say ""people hate H&M""--their designer collabs are always very popular and notorious for selling out in minutes, for example.

But in general the people who regularly buy Cos are probably more used to that price point and buy in that price range often, and they're more interested in Cos's styles and better quality (different from H&M's, which has more variety, from extremely trendy streetwear-style things, to work wear), if you like Cos's style then it's a more tailored shopping experience than H&M (which to me, feels like sifting through mountains of ""stuff"" to find one good item--not everyone is into the treasure hunt approach). 

Conversely the people who buy regularly from H&M probably don't buy often from Cos because they have a different style that H&M provides with its wide variety, and are used to spending at an H&M price point. 

Arket and Other Stories I'm less familiar with since they don't ship to nor have stores in my country, but I imagine similar branding and price differences are at work.",0.21830158730158727,0.5377075702075701,positive
H&M,"I, on the other hand, don't understand how many people see no difference between Cos and h&m in terms of quality. Cos operates almost at a loss, with very low margins. You won't find another mid-range retailer that offers sweaters in 100% RSW wool at their price point (90-150€), or tailored garments in natural materials for less than 200€.
They can only afford this because they are supported by h&m's revenue, which produces poor quality garments with much higher margins and in much larger quantities.

Of course, the minimalist style proposed by Cos does not appeal to everyone like h&m does, but this can be a pro for some people",0.02583333333333333,0.4331666666666667,neutral
H&M,"IMO, and speaking mostly to COS, it’s largely psychological, as the quality isn’t too-too different but the branding and aesthetic is. COS’ silhouettes are a little unusual/somewhat reflective of haute couture and seek to appeal to a consumer that’s a little more in-the-know about fashion than H&M’s clientele. They’ve branded themselves accordingly. Their price points are higher, as that customer base is more willing to spend. The fabrics are also often higher-end than H&M tends to offer (more linen, cotton, wool, less synthetics), though not across the board and not always with great construction.",0.15064102564102563,0.5205128205128206,positive
H&M,"I don't know if anyone is reading labels here but a big part of COS collection has either high amount of natural materials or entirely made out of natural materials. Such as wool, cashmere, mohair or linen. While for H&M, that's like 5-10% of their collection and while I cannot compare knitwear from experience but H&M's linen line is pretty disappointing in quality. Even when you hold the clothes in your hand, COS items are heavier, has better finish in terms of stitching and usually have lining while H&M does not. 

I personally was not impressed by &Other Stories quality either. Haven't tried Arket.

Edit: this said, I'm a loyal H&M client. I don't hate them at all.

With COS, you’re effectively paying for the marketing and branding, but there’s little to no difference between the quality of their products. It’s just packaged more nicely to make you think it’s more luxurious than H&M, when it’s all (probably) made in the same sweatshop.",0.38906250000000003,0.615625,positive
H&M,"Yeah you are way off sorry to say. Its not even the same, at all. Have you even seen the clothes from COS and Arket and &other stories? The materials they use? The fabrics quality? The stitchings? The fit and the models of the clothing? I think not. Either you have not seen the clothes, not felt them, or you are a bit blind to how clothes looks like and think everything looks the same? I mean thats ok too of course and you are asking to learn.

H&M is fast fashion pieces in general made in bad quality materials and you are supposed to use them 1 or 2 seasons and then dispose of them, bc they don't hold up well anyway, the garments lose their shape etc after just a few washing cycles (fast fashion). 

Arket and COS  are for example timeless pieces and looks classic so you can use them year after year, and as they are made of good quality they hold up for a long time if you show good care.

&other stories is very feminine and yes good quality materials and not high fashion so the pieces can be worn for years and look chic.

&#x200B;

I am more familiar with COS and &other stories. COS have quite an ""androgyne"" look and cut on their pieces. Always a bit oversized, (this is for a specific reason)  but its clean cut so their pieces looks elegant. Not all models will fit one person though and what piece will fit you or not depends on your body type.

I haven't made any purchases from Cos, & Other Stories, or Arket yet, but I feel that Arket might be superior to the others. Arket is not that famous because they don't ship to the US, but they are giving a minimalist luxury that I really like, exactly like Massimo Dutti.

H&M,"""Treasure hunt"" - this was my first thought when I saw this post. H&M does have great clothes that might have a similar vibe, but they also have so.much.crap.

Last time I was in H&M (UK), they had all size indicators removed from hangers, so not only certain styles didn't even have my size, I also had to go through the rack checking every piece just to find my size. If I was carrying anything with me, like even a small shopping bag, or maybe some clothes I wanted to try on, that's it, I'm tired within minutes.

 Also their sizes are inconsistent af, but that's a rant for another time. 

Since H&M has all these ranges too, their sales are insufferable to browse in store, it'll have all this cheap trendy stuff marketed to the younger demographic, hardly possible to find any of the nicer quality stuff. Even shopping online is frustrating because of the sheer volume of clothing they have, you have to click a million filters to find anything suitable. 

So yes, to me H&M is just a store where you have to sift through tons of crap, and I hate that. With Cos - it's way more concentrated, their sizing and quality a lot more consistent (for the types of clothes I go for, anyway).  While some pieces look like they could be found in either of these stores, for me Cos is the winner hands down due to the shopping experience itself.",0.051533189033189035,0.583423520923521,mixed

H&M,"I should have made it clear that I was mentally comparing COS with H&M when it actually tries. The H&M by me has a bottom “junk” floor and a top floor devoted to nicer professional clothing. The junk floor (checker-print baby Ts, little cotton-poly wrap skirts that are $19.99, etc.) is miles away from COS, I agree. But comparing the top floor and COS, I don’t find that there’s a ton of difference except fabric and sophistication of the design. COS fabric can be genuinely nice (though I’ve had recent disappointments) - soft, weighty, natural fibers that actually make sense with the garment they’re used for and drape nicely. But construction-wise, it doesn’t really exceed the nicer items I’ve bought from H&M, which have proven to be fairly durable.

For example, I’ve rarely seen darting or other thoughtful tailored touches that could really elevate a piece of clothing from COS but also cause production costs to rise. I bought a $200 column dress from there that was very interesting (cool color, moved nicely) and made of very high-end viscose, but the actual  construction was very simple. The only thing that differentiated it from H&M was the fabric and the fact that H&M would never sell something that unique.",0.22453703703703703,0.515652557319224,positive

Better fabric, better construction, better quality overall as you mentioned. The skirt i mentioned is my go-to on flights, is flatteringly cut and hardly ever creases. It might be the high street and fast fashion but it doesn't have to be throwaway.

I do have older H&M pieces from 2007-08 that still look good so it's not that H&M = crap by default. But Arket, COS, & Other Stories tended to look better-quality when I could see things in-store.

Uniqlo,"Yes I have heard about Reformation, and I've browsed through their shoes on the website before, but I've never taken the plunge and actually bought something from them.

I can't think of any brands that are exactly in line with Massimo Dutti & Arket's offerings, although I can think of brands who, in the past, have released specific items or ranges that are in line with certain aspects of those two brands, and that have impressed me in terms of quality. Like for example, Uniqlo's Merino Wool jumpers and turtlenecks that they re-release every year in a billion different colours. That's quite ""Arket-esque everyday minimalist"" to me, because you just throw those on and go, and they're 100% real wool so they meet the natural fibre knitwear criterion.

Disclaimer, I've not tried either of these brands: certain pieces from Arket/Massimo Dutti I've found variants of on Anthropologie's website i.e. tulle skirts and organza trench coats (all polyester though I'm afraid), so Anthropologie might be worth keeping an eye on. 

Also, Banana Republic, although being more of a workwear-geared brand, seems to stick to neutral tones, and that reminds me a lot of Massimo Dutti's more ""clean"" and ""elegant"" pieces, which are also often in the neutral/white/black/grey/brown colour family.

Gap,"As an avid COS and &OtherStories lover, a lot of commentators already mentioned the distinction between the brands and provided great parallels like Gap/Old Navy or Tom Ford/Clinique. Arket  is more like Zara/Massimo Dutti, shame that stuff is not available in US.

So why do I shop at COS and &OtherStories for the past 15 years, but not H&M? 
- Mostly design. I love more masculine tailored sharp look of COS for everyday. Even something that leans more casual as [elasticated pants](https://www.cos.com/en_usd/women/womenswear/trousers/product.pleated-wide-leg-wool-pants-black.1129638001.html) has pleats to make it more formal and is made out of wool to bring it to the next level. I go to the OtherStories if I want something more casual and feminine. With ditsy print, lilac color or a dress. 
- materials. Way more wool, cotton, silk, alpaca, cashmere etc. And not all polyester/acrylic is created equal!
- quality. I loved H&M at one point and had a lot of stuff, but the only things I have left at the moment are red lace panties and a blazer from Premium Selection. Everything else perished. Literally. I’m not saying I didn't use it and donated, I threw it out due to holes or extreme stretching out. I still have COS pants from over a decade ago and I wear them every winter. If I’m being picky I feel like the quality of the knit clothes in COS went down. Especially some wool pieces tend to shrink horribly on me even after washing in cold water. It's so random, I don't get it. Other than that, I’m very satisfied with the quality. Their basics like cotton long sleeve shirts, t-shirts, pants, poplin shirts, and wool turtlenecks are absolutely amazing. 
- it fits my body. I’m 5’2 and surprisingly most of the stuff fits me just right. I know that with an oversized sweater, I need to size down otherwise sleeves gonna be too long. I know that pants are true to my size 4 and they mostly be like full-length pants. It's easy to order online when you know how the sizing works.

Zara,"I've recently started selling on Vinted to get rid of my excess clothing and have noticed a very strange pattern. I can post a beautiful, vintage, pure wool dress or blazer, and get absolutely no interest, but a some cheap Zara top? Gone in ten minutes, and not particularly cheap. Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren sell for good percentages of their original cost, despite being made in Bangladesh or China.

On the other hand, when I search for things, I put in ""Made in France 100% linen"", etc. The country and the material, in both English and other languages (I'm in Europe and have access to French Vinted). I buy absolutely fantastic, well-made, all natural fibre pieces for 1-3 euros on average, while the popular brands are much more sought after. Once I know a brand is made somewhere, I save that brand and now have an enormous list, which I will share below. The biggest advice I can give anyone is this: change your parameters. Lose faith in big brands, traditional brands, your favourite brand. Judge items purely by where they're made, what they're made of, and how well they're made (and the measurements for your body). You can tell the quality of manufacturing by how straight seams are, how good pattern matching is, whether it's lined, whether hems are machine or hand sewed, etc. If you can, find out the manufacturing conditions as well - vintage brands are less likely to have the issues inherent to globalisation. If you have any questions, please post them so I can try and answer them.

EDIT: It should be noted that some brands, like DVF, Massimo Dutti, Cache Cache, etc., still exist today and are much lower quality than their vintage counterpoints. Make sure to see photos of the labels!

EDIT 2: If you know of any other brands, current or vintage, that are made in well-paid and safe conditions, please post them! This list is not meant to be eurocentric, it's just that I'm EU-based and that's what I encounter. There are fantastic brands from all countries and I'm only looking to avoid poor conditions, not certain countries or regions.

a) people's definition of 'used, very good' has sometimes been \*very\* different from mine 

b) filtering by size can be impossible as the system is convinced that 'size L' and 'size UK 12' are the same thing, so you get lots of things listed as 'L./12' that may be a L or may be a 12 but aren't necessarily both and you have to click through to see which is the case for brands where L is, say, a 16 

c)it gets really wearying seeing dozens of terrible descriptions ('size 14, true to size' tells me nothing, give me measurements, especially if it's vintage!) 

So I think people who know they are X size in Zara are going to be more confident buying a Zara top than they are brands that are harder to find on the high street.

Is La Redoute decent quality? They used to be a catalogue retailer so I assumed they were on a par with Very etc.",0.07518518518518519,0.5867592592592594,mixed
Zara,"I find vintage textile production so interesting and can spend literally hours looking at vintage clothing. I constantly tell my husband about vintage brands and their history (like abercrombie!), so I completely understand where you’re coming from. There was an era where great quality clothing was accessible to everyone at all types of stores- there was still of course high end brands and expensive clothing, but you could find beautifully made dresses at say, JC Penney’s. I still buy some modern brands second hand, but I try to be more discerning and support small designers or slow fashion. I also put more weight towards fabric and ethical working conditions, even in second hand purchases. I see cute Zara clothing but i just cant justify supporting them knowing how terrible they are to their workers, even secondarily (and they do have some really cute items)

I agree that high quality items are great, but things like wool, silk, cashmere need to be treated expertly to stay in shape.

No need to say that sellers didn’t acknowledge the problem and I couldn’t return or resell them. Money down the drain. Not doing this anymore. Only buy that kind of stuff in real life thrift markets where I can clearly see the state they’re in.

It's also a very good point that there are sweatshops in Europe, especially with non-European undocumented and underpaid labour. I do try to mention this in one of my other comments, but it's hard to cover everything. Value is absolutely not directly linked to country of origin, but you have a better chance of getting something good made in France than by H&M in China. But absolutely, not a rule. My point was for people to look beyond the brands they know, which are often poorly and exploitatively produced, for products that may have been made in better conditions and be better quality. It's not that secondhand fast fashion should necessarily be boycotted, but that better things for the same price can often be had. 


I do try to research most of the brands I save and the majority are brands which are no longer in business and sold in the 50s-90s, so avoiding many of the pitfalls of globalisation. 


It's a complex issue and you're right to point out the complexities - it's not the countries I want to avoid, but the practices that are more common there. ",0.16016190476190478,0.5332952380952382,positive

Uniqlo,"I think a big part of the issue is the platform. When Vinted was still available in Canada, I found it much more akin to Depop - younger buyer base, so name brands were the items that tended to move the fastest, as opposed to items based on material or make.

I have been thrifting since middle school (and online secondhand shopping since ThredUp started shipping to Canada) so I know the value in focusing on material over brand (currently wearing a 1980s pure linen Talbots blouse with Uniqlo linen blend pants) but buying vintage - even what I'd classify as 'newer' vintage (1990s to 2000s) - is a learned skill that not everyone has the time or patience for.

Uniqlo,"gah, half my wardrobe is from Uniqlo! I think they're great value for the money--they do little things like matching plaids or including linings that I don't see on mall brand clothes that are 2-3 times the price.

I haven't seen the Blocktech parka mentioned, I have one (after eyeing expensive ones like Rains) and love it, super lightweight and easy to pack into a bag, chic, and waterproof, of course. 

The Ultra Stretch jeans and cigarette jeans are very comfortable, really nice quality. The leggings pants are a classic too! I had weird sizing issues last time I ordered the EZ pants, the thighs were too tight but that is literally the only time I've ever had that issue bc I'm more of an apple shape. It was a year or two ago, so the cut may have been changed since then.

Keep an eye out for all the artist collabs, I really love some of them (most recently Dusen Dusen). I think IDLF and Uniqlo U tend to have higher quality than the main lines but the IDLF clothes also run smaller. 

Skip the cashmere, it's not that great. I have a couple of merino tees that I really like, it doesn't feel luxe but it's soft and fairly dressy.

I love the sweatpants/sweatshirts--one kind has a kind of dry terrycloth inside that's nice when you don't want to feel really sweaty, one kind has a soft fake fur with a thick fleecy pile inside that is super cozy when it's cold out.

I think the Heattech stuff is just OK. The texture feels weird to me, very thin and synthetic.
 
The dresses tend to be too long and shapeless.

I like their flannels but I've found that if you run them through the dryer, over time, the sleeves shrink in this weird wrinkly way like seersucker, so I would recommend hang drying them.

I had an olive green parka from them that the dry cleaner lost and I still feel sad when I think about it, it was my favorite jacket.

the loungewear - the relaco shorts or ultra stretch lounge sets. I like they drape printed pants, but the jogger ones are a bit slightly too short for me. 

the feather/ultralight line - lots of companies now do it, but at their price range uniqlo is unbeatable for comfort and compactness and warmth. Also they have by far the widest range of cuts and nice colors, they have awesome colors for this. A ultralight layer is incredibly useful.

Flannel - their flannel is nice. Waffle material also.

Heattech works though it is not as nice feeling as merino wool or other high tech more expensive materials. I dislike their airism material though.

I got a pair of drape jersey pants there a year ago which have been excellent and would buy more but have not seen them yet.

merino - the merino is nice and feels nice, though it is not  the best merino. A warning, their cuts can be a bit too boring and uninteresting, same about colors. They have nice color lines for some things, for the merinos it's usually very boring.

Stuff I do not like:
airism  and some synthetics - feels synthetic, clammy.
Pants and the ezy pants in particular - often too short, they do not fit me right and the ezy pants the material often feels weird.

I headed to H&M ready to try on some jeans that button up with ease and I found them! (Divided Skinny Jeans High Waisted)

In all my excitement about having my stomach fit comfortably I forgot one crucial thing: CHECK THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE POCKETS.

I got home, ripped the tag off, put them on, left my apartment, WENT TO PUT MY PHONE IN THE FRONT POCKET and subsequently died on the inside.

Fake pockets are the worst, I’m so annoyed. At least the bum ones work I guess.

ETA: Thank you for all the responses. I was not expecting to wake up in 2022 with nearly 100 comments!

Their brand image says ""we provide you the best dupes with the fastest turnaround, don't ask us how we do it"". Their ethos is to produce clothes that are extremely trendy, meant to be worn for a season. There's no such thing as investment pieces or quality basics with Zara unless you get lucky and find something that personally looks nice to you regardless of trend.

I've also noticed that Zara's clothes are pretty terrible quality for money in general. I was interested in finding an affordable faux shearling jacket (an Acne Velocity dupe) and knew that that was kind of Zara's forte, so I went looking out of curiosity. The jacket that they had on offer mostly ticked the boxes in terms of design and even the faux leather they used looked and felt pretty nice.

The issue was that the craftsmanship was really bad. Unfinished seams, uneven cut raw edges here and there, janky zipper, faux fur squeezing through from the shoulder seams etc. And this was a jacket worth £89. It clearly wasn't a jacket you would buy and cherish for many years, it was a *costume prop* for that one night when you want to play dress up. Zara doesn't care whether it looks good or lasts for a long time, as long as the customer is happy with it for that one night, cool.

Noped the hell out of there and decided that if I wanted a shearling jacket I'd have to accept the price I have to pay for one or be content without (I chose the latter).

This is absolutely true, unless consumer *demand* change *specifically* dealing with workers rights. This has happened before, but almost never sticks. And it won't, as long as people keep forgetting and going back to purchase from their companies.

Responding to some of your below points:

>The problem with this is that places with low wages and poor working conditions don't really have any other advantages besides low labor cost

But you're ignoring the fact that wages are kept low [*due* to western exploitation](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/world/asia/bangladesh-takes-step-toward-raising-38-a-month-minimum-wage.html) and the threat of moving to countries with even cheaper labor, continuing this perpetual cycle. Until consumers are educated and voting with their wallets, companies have a myriad of ways to weasel their way out of paying their workers. 

>for instance, China used to be a place where a lot of this very low wage clothes manufacturing occurred, but as economic conditions gradually improved from foreign and local investment

Holy moly. You can't condense the reason for China's economic upturn as simply ""foreign and local investment"", that is just...insane.

Zara,"But that's a total fallacy.  Your premise is a country can work its way out of poverty through acceptance of and participation in, essentially, slave labor--that at some point, developing countries will have saved enough pennies to buy their way out of being exploited and gain access to a world where they are the exploiters.  In this argument, your better world is one where exploited countries can earn their right to join the 'developed' elite and get their day to push around another developing country.  

You can see how this played out in Turkey, where these notes originate.  Recent political events in the Middle East has created growing instability in Turkey, which culminated in a failed coup d'etat and continuing sociopolitical turmoil.  These political events were predicated by the ongoing conflict in Syria and a collapsing bid to join the EU.  

Turkey has been wanting to join the EU for a long time--and the EU had wanted Turkey to join too due to its ideal geographic location and its robust economy.  Just like in this ideal world, Turkey wanted a way to join the 'cool kids table' to reap the economic benefits of a developed economy that was bffs with other developed economies; but the EU kept saying Turkey wasn't ready for the EU.

Then the Syrian civil war burst on the scene, causing a refugee crisis in the EU.  The refugee crisis had the potential the cause many issues, including imagined ones--none of which the EU was ready to confront.  The EU then reached out to Turkey and promised Turkey a way to join the EU in return for acting as a buffer for the refugee crisis.  The EU would send back Syrian refugees to Turkey for processing and Turkey would send them into the EU at a gradual rate.

Aside from acting as a refugee buffer to the EU, Turkey was also physical and political buffer between the Syrian conflict and the EU.  As a result, Turkey was both used as a dump site for refugees and blamed for aiding and abetting IS fighters/Islamic militants by various Western powers (including the US).  

At the same time, Turkey had to deal with all the security issues of being next to a country experiencing a civil war fueled by foreign political, economic, and military involvement.  In 2016, Turkey experienced a wave of IS terrorist attacks, which caused widespread criticism of the incumbent political leadership.

So, caught in this maelstrom of crap, Turkey's military attempts a coup which fails.  This then causes the president to swing sharply toward the right and impose semi-autocratic rule.  This results in a series of purges which has de-stablized the social and economic fabric of the country.  Unsurprisingly, factories close as a result; and in a dampened economy, the unpaid workers can't get much in the way of other work.

Oh yeah, and the EU is back to saying that Turkey isn't Western enough to join the club again.  

Now, Zara didn't cause the Syrian civil war; but I certainly can't see a subplot in this story, where Zara was helping Turkey overcome its social, political, and economic struggles.  If anything, Zara and its customers benefited from 1) Turkey acting as a buffer to the refugee crisis, which offset real and imagined economic stress to developed countries, allowing participants in those economies to continue to buy clothes; and 2) a destabilized Turkey where wages would be kept low due to a lack of other opportunities, which allows corporations to wedge the country into a prolonged dependence on manufacturing.  This seriously calls into question the role of corporations as ethically neutral sources of revenue into Turkey, since there are incentives for companies to keep the developing world in an economically stunted position.

And the saddest part is Turkey is just one of many countries experiencing this type of complex exploitation from a developed economy.  Capitalism is a system where if a player is not exploited then it is probably exploiting another player.  

This is a large part of why China is 'emerging' as you like to claim.  It's not because Chinese people have assembled enough iPhones to pay their way out of that slave-wage life; but because China is aggressively offsetting that type of exploitation onto other players--like Africa--or internalizing and concealing it by offsetting it into isolated sectors of the population--like political prisoners.

All this works to call into question whether one poorer country in the world through corporate exploitation and conquest is even a cause that is worth supporting--even wearily.

H&M,"The time, effort, and materials cost needed to produce clothing are much higher than most people have been lead to believe. We live in a culture where clothes are mass-produced to be worn and discarded within the year. Clothing that is made from natural or sustainable materials of high-quality construction by seamstresses that are treated right is extremely expensive. 
This is why most people made their own clothes until recently (around the 1960s is when this really started changing). Fabric is very valuable if it is of good quality and garments used to be worn for around 5-10 years and then the fabric or garment would be modified into the new trend. This is how the working class used to dress. If someone doesn't have the money to purchase quality garments then maybe they should look into learning to make them themselves or as you mentioned, thrifting is a feasible option in today's market(this is what I do). 
Thrifting is actually the best way you can shop for the environment because you aren't bringing more materials into the cycle, and with basic sewing skills, you can easily transform and garment into something that works for you. The amount of discarded clothes currently in the system could easily clothe the whole world, yet many companies refuse to donate unwanted products and instead destroy them. H&M has been documented burning millions of pounds of clothes. 
If we want poor people to have access to good, sustainable clothing we have to make it the new normal and not let companies trick us (via a scarcity mindset) into thinking that what they produce is valuable. We have to change our personal values to see a change in the system. The cost of quality garments will go down slightly as production increases, and the second-hand market for those goods will increase dramatically.",0.207974987974988,0.4497342472342473,positive

H&M,"> If someone doesn't have the money to purchase quality garments then maybe they should look into learning to make them themselves 

Sewing is not cost effective. It takes time, equipment, materials, and skill - more skill than I think you appreciate. I can sew some things, more adequately than most people. I could make a t-shirt, simple dress or (drawstring or elastic waist) trousers/skirt. But jeans? Socks? Bras? A suit? Jackets? Anything fashionable? Hell no. The patience and attention to detail required for something as basic as button holes or inset zippers is frankly beyond me. Sewing basic clothing that doesn't look like shit is NOT easy. It takes a ton of time and knowledge and shouldn't be presented as an affordable and realistic solution in a world where most adults are working at least one job outside the home. Furthermore, quality fabric is shockingly expensive.

H&M,"> We have transitioned to an incredibly greedy society to expect such things at the click of a button

> Our own greed has lead to the abuses we see in Indonesia and Bangladesh.

You seem to think human rights abuses started in the 1960s. Maybe you're not familiar with history, but the garment industry has always been vile. Ever heard of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire or the East India Trading Company or the Civil War? Child labor, slavery, inadequate wages, unsafe working conditions, environmental degradation - these are par for the course. 

For the last 500+ years, the garment industry has moved across the globe so that garment production is always in a nation with inadequate environmental and labor protections. It's just a matter of time before Bangladesh and Indonesia implement regulations to protect their people and the environment, and then the garment industry will move to Africa to continue it's exploitative practices.

But sure, let's blame it on modern greed.

As for the ethics or sustainability of hand-sewn garments in the past - what a joke. I am sure the Cotton Belt and East Indies plantations that produced the fabric for the ethically handsewn garments of yore were real sustainable and ethical... Surely the cotton wasn't grown on land sized through the genocide of Native Americans or the colonial oppression of indigenous people. Surely it wasn't planted and picked by the oppressed and impoverished members of a racial minority, including the descendants of people who were kidnapped and sold into racial slavery. Surely it wasn't dyed in vats of indigo that slowly poisoned the workers. Surely it wasn't loomed in factories with unsafe working conditions and inadequate labor protections (including child labor).

Nope, all of these things stem from modern greed, and it's all the fault of companies like H&M and the greedy, greedy poor people who think they deserve the privilege of wearing clothing that isn't from the thrift store (a magical place which washes used garment clean the sins of the garment industry).",0.21431159420289858,0.5978260869565217,positive

In an economic system based on private property, at this stage in the lifespan of the system especially (decay), the cheaper process wins. Not the most *rational* process, but the most cheap per unit, able to churn out more and more volume at relatively lower cost. This is why the classic luxury brands are all playing more or less by fast fashion rules now, e.g. where and under what conditions they're sourcing and processing textiles.  
  
Because of the anarchy governing the market, it appears profitable from the point of view of one enterprise to produce a certain number of unites. However, the reason it's profitable is that the cost to produce it is lower than the price - extrapolate this to the whole economy and you see how overproduction is completely natural and the fundamental cause of crises.

There’s a Uniqlo type line called “Basic” (how original lmao), an Aeropostale section called LOGG, a Forever21 section called Divided and so on. They even launched an athletic line in the last year or two (to compete with Athleta) and do a decent amount of brand partnerships so they can compete with/be named alongside luxury brands. 

Sales being down aside, I think this is a genius idea; it’s like a department store/clothing Target. Customers walk in looking for a tshirt, and walk out with a pillow (they now sell home goods stateside!), panties, jeans, and a dress, too.

I've had some pants fraying out after just a few months and it was exhausting to try on clothes because the L in one style is XL in another.

In an economic system based on private property, at this stage in the lifespan of the system especially (decay), the cheaper process wins. Not the most *rational* process, but the most cheap per unit, able to churn out more and more volume at relatively lower cost. This is why the classic luxury brands are all playing more or less by fast fashion rules now, e.g. where and under what conditions they're sourcing and processing textiles.  
  
Because of the anarchy governing the market, it appears profitable from the point of view of one enterprise to produce a certain number of unites. However, the reason it's profitable is that the cost to produce it is lower than the price - extrapolate this to the whole economy and you see how overproduction is completely natural and the fundamental cause of crises. The average worker is the average consumer, and their wages are too low to buy back what is produced at the price at which it's sold.

If they focused on designed basics and made that their signature I think they could do it.

This is me :| Living in SE Asia, used to be excited that H&M opened shop here a few years back. While they're not exactly cheap, they were a decent mid-range option at this side of the globe. But after a while, I've stopped going to their stores, simply because sizing and quality are inconsistent. I've had some pants fraying out after just a few months and it was exhausting to try on clothes because the L in one style is XL in another.

Compare them to Uniqlo, which had really really great selections. Their pocketable parkas (actually, light jackets) has a great design and their leggings are great value for money; the Uniqlo leggings I have is more than a year old already and is still in good condition, despite regular use.

**Vuori** 

Halo Essential Wide Leg Pants: [https://vuoriclothing.com/products/womens-halo-essential-wideleg-black-heather?queryId=531c56e3941e18fb90346ba305e51c32&collection=womens-pants](https://vuoriclothing.com/products/womens-halo-essential-wideleg-black-heather?queryId=531c56e3941e18fb90346ba305e51c32&collection=womens-pants)

Purchased this to run errands and travel (I fly atleast 6 - 8 times a year).

Date of Purchase: October 4, 2024 Cost per Wear: $6.19. I have worn this \~20 times.

Pros:

1. The material is very soft. I like the drape of the pant as well. I got the hem of the pants tailored because it was too long for me. I did this after wearing the pants \~5 times. Including hemming the pants this cost me 130$.

Cons:

1. The 10th time I wore it I saw pilling on the outer thigh area. I hadn't washed my pants yet (I wear thermals underneath always). This was annoying because I expected the pants to pill after using it a lot more. Since I spent so much money and time in these stupid pants I'm going to make an effort to wear them atleast until the cost per wear goes below 2$.

**Sezane** 

Gaspard Cardigan: [https://www.sezane.com/us/product/gaspard-cardigan/ecru#size-XS](https://www.sezane.com/us/product/gaspard-cardigan/ecru#size-XS)

Pros:

1. I like that the color of the buttons matches the color of the cardigan.

Cons:

1. Extremely oversized. I'm usually an S/M but I got an XS and it still fit badly.
2. I got the ecru color which was very see through. The material was very thin. I felt like it was tissue paper stitched into a sweater.
3. The column of buttons on the sweater seemed badly stitched in ? It looks bumpy and shabby.
4. Overall the sweater looked like I had washed it in a washing machine once or twice

I got annoyed and returned it immediately.

Date of Purchase: September 7, 2023 Cost per Wear: $4.64. I have worn this \~30 times. I bought this for 130$

Pros:

1. Doesn't get crumpled. Easy to maintain
2. Looks classy for work. I like the way it drapes

**Doc Martens**

I think its this: [https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/1460-reclaimed-leather-lace-up-boots-black/p/31808001](https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/1460-reclaimed-leather-lace-up-boots-black/p/31808001)

Date of Purchase: Sometime around 2022 Cost per wear: 5$. I've worn this \~30 times.

Pros:

1. Looks nice even after so many years and many times wearing it. The slight signs of wear makes it look lived in rather than shabby / worn out.

Cons:

1. Its time consuming to put on.

Date of Purchase: Dec 2024 Cost per Wear: 16.66$. I have worn this \~9 times.

Pros:

1. Thick enough to be a sweater (unlike the Sezane piece). Its also thin enough to be a layering piece. Works both ways basically.
2. Looks nice ... material feels nice

Combine that with the rise of Zara and other international fast-fashion competitors, the burst of flash sale sites (which has mostly fizzled, but they definitely did damage in their heyday) and the overall shift in consumer shopping patterns toward online purchasing, and the mid-tier retailers are left with a hilariously shitty business model.

Zara,"> I think it's that last trend that is most ominous for mid-tier retail: we've started thinking about clothes as either Buy It For Life or cheap thrills, which leaves no role for anything in the middle. Clothes that are meant to last 1-3 years have basically no place in this ongoing fantasy of wardrobe optimization and permanence.

I definitely, definitely feel this is true for me. I bought in very heavily to this idea of having ""investment pieces"" and I definitely think about my wardrobe in this hyper-strategic way…so even when I was on a very small budget it seemed totally reasonable to me that _one day_ when I had more money I'd save up and buy a Nice Handbag or a High-Quality Sweater. 

At the same time, I think it's super fun and engaging to look at fast fashion (I compulsively walk into every single Zara I see) just because everything is really new, and fun, and fresh, and it feels reasonable to buy an exaggerated piece (a bright red faux suede skirt) that's informed by runway fashion and makes a statement…but isn't so expensive that you regret buying such an impractical thing.

> E-commerce has made shopping a much more *frequent* activity for most people, as opposed to the big beginning-of-season shopping trips of yore.

This is a really fascinating topic and I would be super interested in hearing about how other FFAers have adapted their shopping styles. I think the old-school concept of buying clothes to go back to school, or getting your winter shopping out of the way early on, is very outdated at this point.

I think even casual shoppers (people who aren't feverishly into fashion) still do a lot of frequent ambient shopping—just checking out new shoes online, looking at different trends you see in your environment or online and getting excited about a new style of shoes or jackets or whatever…",0.12498541313758703,0.48379540749105965,positive
H&M,"Buzzfeed put up a great article today titled ""[Gap’s Struggles Are Highlighting The Misery Of Mid-Priced Clothing](http://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/the-60-dollar-sweater-crisis)"" and I thought it reflected a lot of the complaints FFA has been making over the past year or so about mid-priced mall brands. I'd really love to hear everyone's thoughts on this ~

> The past year has seen a steady pounding of mid-priced apparel — the stuff that lives between fast-fashion and “value” clothing on one end and luxury, name-brand goods at the other. Gap and Banana Republic, prime examples of this group, performed dismally in 2015, along with J.Crew, Anthropologie and Macy’s…
> 
> Between the plethora of outlets, off-pricers like Marshalls and Nordstrom Rack and fast-fashion chains like H&M and Forever 21, it’s gotten hard to make the case for a $60 Gap sweater or $85 J.Crew cardigan. And the frequent discounts at these chains, as advertised in constant emails promising 40% off for one day only, aren’t helping matters.

I'm really curious how other FFAers feel about this! I've personally felt this disenchantment with a lot of middle-market brands. A lot of my wardrobe now is Uniqlo (inexpensive, very standard, basic pieces) and then I'll occasionally spend more on a designer item (where I feel the quality is a huge step up or the style is particularly distinct and original and novel). J. Crew often doesn't seem interesting enough or high-quality enough to make me want to spend $120 on a sweater at MSRP.

There's also some speculation in the article on how the ""millennial generation"" (am I the only one that gets immediately defensive when news articles start generalizing about millennials?) may be prioritizing spending differently:

H&M,"Many have mentioned the issue of quality--that was my first thought reading this. Why pay for the name, when the quality isn't so much more than H&M/Target/Old Navy? And it's not just construction--good grief, polyester and acrylic have invaded every garment type in every store. I think that's absolutely the mid-price retailers' biggest problem.

But another thing in the article really struck me: the retailers thinking the right product/trend hasn't come back along. A couple years ago, I settled into my current weight after years of weight loss. I lost a total of ~145 pounds and it was the first time since I was eight or so that I wasn't plus-sized. I had always imagined the non-plus-sized clothing landscape as a fashion wonderland. Lo and behold, here it is two years later, and I maybe own half as many clothes as I once did--and I have exponentially more places to shop. I don't think, for example, minimalism thrills everyone who isn't plugged into fashion (hell, it doesn't thrill me in general), and it's everywhere. All the stores try to jump on any given trend, which is understandable, but it means none of them have THAT distinct of a style anymore. This compounds the quality problem. I'll pay more for a lower-quality garment with more embellishments, and I doubt I'm unique in that. So between quality and style, we as consumers are not just comparing sweaters between H&M and Ann Taylor, we're actually comparing something specific like basic cotton-rayon-poly blend v-neck hip-length cable cardigans in almost the same color options.

H&M,"I'm going to offer up an unpopular opinion: I shop at Gap quite frequently for basics and staples for my work and casual wardrobe. It's the one brand where I always know my clothing size so I can buy stuff online and 95% of the time it will fit exactly how I want it to. However, as a young adult, there are many items that they sell that I ignore because they remind me of my Mom's wardrobe or the materials are really off.

 I ALWAYS read reviews and am skeptical about products that have none at all (they definitely remove or refuse to post negative reviews of shitty products). I am happy to shop at Gap with a few basic rules/thoughts in mind: 1. If the material is largely synthetic, find something else 2. Do you like the color? Will you like the color in a different season or year? 3. Does it remind you of an item you would like from a more expensive store, e.g. Madewell (which matches most of my fashion aesthetic)? I view Gap as my favorite low-end rather than mid-range clothing store because when I compare prices and quality of items there versus stuff I've bought from Forever 21, H&M, etc. I like my Gap stuff way more and it lasts longer in terms of style and everyday wear. Plus, I NEVER buy their stuff full price because of the store's penchant for inflating ""regular"" prices. I typically wait for their stuff to go on sale to combine with 40% off sales so I buy clothes from their for 50-75% off, making the product prices comparable to fast fashion retailers.

Lastly, I do have to be really picky about what I buy. I don't have a Gap in my town so I order online and send back about 1/4 of what I purchase (but luckily their free returns and quick refund policies make this easy). I feel like despite all of these caveats, I'm happy with my Gap clothes because it means that I can have more clothing which matches my aesthetic for a cheaper price. I'm not at a point in my life where I can splurge on a $100+ item more than a couple of times a year so Gap fits my current wardrobe needs. 

tl;dr Gap doesn't totally suck, it's just necessary to change your perspective about how to effectively shop there if your fashion identity aligns most with Madewell (like mine).",0.18164924506387922,0.5141584025730367,positive

H&M,"**tl;dr** bc I got too excited by this question—I don't think it's unreasonable to expect high quality. There are lots of dimensions of quality and I think it basically comes down to knowing what materials and types of items you can buy frugally (not many designer jeans will be substantially higher quality than generic Levi's). A lot of discussion on clothing items ""falling apart"" is overhyped, imo—and it partly has to do with our false expectations for what durability we can actually get at a certain price, and there are lots of ways to care for clothes to help them last longer.

—

> So, are we at a time now where it is unrealistic to expect clothing to last and be high quality?

I'm actually reminded of a great FFA thread from two years ago—[""Where is the middle ground between fast fashion and designer prices?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/189plz/where_is_the_middle_ground_between_fast_fashion/)—which is possibly related and you might find it interesting. To your question, I really don't think quality has entirely evaporated from the market, but there are a ton of cultural/market tensions that mean:

* a lot of clothing sold is fast fashion, which is produced on a very short cycle and meant to make money at volume because the prices are so low—none of this stuff is _meant_ to last, it's just an unexpected bonus if it does
* consumers are inured to rock-bottom prices and many of us, quite honestly, aren't buying stuff that has the margins/capability to be high-quality anyway, and we have artificial expectations on what quality we can actually expect
* because of the price pressures on retailers to keep prices low, have good sales, &c &c, clothing prices haven't risen in tandem with inflation + increasing material costs, so there are costs being cut _somewhere_, and often in material/construction quality

I can dig up stats on this if you'd like, but in the past few decades American consumers have spent a lower %age of their income on clothing than we did in the past. So when people talk about the good old days with higher-quality clothing, I often suspect that:

* people were paying more for clothes back then
* the concept of fast fashion and disposable clothing didn't really exist
* selection bias—only the solid, well-made clothing is still here with us today

So I think in many ways FFA can veer towards being overly cynical and overly demanding of the garment industry today. I really think this is an issue where we're being sold a bill of goods (high quality garments bought new at Gap that reflect Gap's storied legacy) that isn't actually true (the quality isn't there because the price is too low to do better). It could also be, of course, that retailers are just trying to milk as much money out of consumers as possible, but I think that many mid-market retailers _know_ that people want better quality—they are just unable to provide it at the price, or have (in some cases) deduced that people can have a very vague sense of what quality means to them.

To be honest, it's quite possible for lots of items (even fast fashion ones) to ""last"", too, depending on what you mean. It varies so much:

* H&M cotton tank dress I've owned for about 4 years — I maybe wear it 30 times max in a year, I wash it cold and hang dry (like all of my clothes), and it hasn't pilled at all.
* acrylic blend Gap sweater I bought 4 years ago and ""lasted"" half a year — shrunken and warped after washing it once. Sweaters (especially acrylic ones) do badly with machine washing and _horribly_ after machine drying!
* Madewell denim shorts I've owned for a year and a half — maybe 100 wears at this point? I don't think anything's really changed about them.
* Urban Outfitters skinny jeans — the dye washed out (they were black and turned a dark blue) after a year (maybe ~100 wears?) and the knees got incredibly threadbare.

I think there are lots of dimensions of quality and lots of ways in which things degrade. Levi's jeans and Gap jeans are pretty inexpensive and sturdy (imo, paying more—e.g. $150 for a pair of jeans—doesn't get you substantially better quality). A lot of items straight up are not meant to last (if you wear a t-shirt regularly, it will absolutely pill at high-friction areas). A lot of items need better care to survive longer (machine-drying is brutal on clothing! leather should be cleaned and conditioned!).",0.05127561327561327,0.4678641489229724,neutral

I'm the opposite - this is completely not true for me. All I want is clothes that will last a couple of years!

At this stage in my life (grad student) I don't have a lot of disposable income to spend on designer, buy it for life, items, but I also don't want to spend a lot of time and energy replacing items as they wear out. I'm also aware that my tastes will probably shift over time, which is another reason not to buy ""investment"" pieces. 

I just want to buy a solid pair of jeans that will survive my thighs longer than a year so that I can buy new jeans because I want a different style rather than because they have holes in. Ditto things like simple tops and t shirts - I want items that will remain smart enough for work, without major pilling or stretching, for long enough for my tastes to change. 

I basically buy everything from Uniqlo now, and certain things from H&M because I've had good luck with some items in the past and at least they're easy to replace. Uniqlo is what Gap was 10-15 years ago - simple clothes in a wide range of colours of decent quality. But this middle ground is hard to find for those of us who still want it.

Crew specifically because of that dress-- the fabric blends were either similar to H&M's but at least 3x the cost, and the wool/silk/etc. was exorbitant. 

Building off of that: it's totally possible to create a lasting wardrobe from lower-end retailers. Aside from the fact that I don't know what people are doing that they wear out t-shirts in a year, Forever21 and H&M always have a few items made out of sturdy fabrics.

> Between the plethora of outlets, off-pricers like Marshalls and Nordstrom Rack and fast-fashion chains like H&M and Forever 21, it’s gotten hard to make the case for a $60 Gap sweater or $85 J.Crew cardigan. And the frequent discounts at these chains, as advertised in constant emails promising 40% off for one day only, aren’t helping matters.

I'm really curious how other FFAers feel about this! I've personally felt this disenchantment with a lot of middle-market brands. A lot of my wardrobe now is Uniqlo (inexpensive, very standard, basic pieces) and then I'll occasionally spend more on a designer item (where I feel the quality is a huge step up or the style is particularly distinct and original and novel). J. Crew often doesn't seem interesting enough or high-quality enough to make me want to spend $120 on a sweater at MSRP.

There's also some speculation in the article on how the ""millennial generation"" (am I the only one that gets immediately defensive when news articles start generalizing about millennials?) may be prioritizing spending differently:

Uniqlo,">~Wardrobe overhauls~ and closet purging have become a more massive phenomenon than ever before, which prompts more shopping and more clothes owned over a lifetime as people constantly discard and replace things in a quest for the perfect wardrobe.

I saw an interesting criticism of this lifestyle trend in an article earlier. It was a competitor of Marie Kendo's in Japan, and she was saying that that KonMari style of tidying up is made possible, in part, because we have so many more items we don't really care about these days. Because Uniqlo or Target will sell you a t-shirt that doesn't have to last five years, and you expect it to get a hole in the seam, and it wasn't perfect to begin with so it's no great loss when you throw it out. 

I would have to agree with regard to midlevel retailers. There are very few items in my closet that I would call ""favorites."" And at the same time, I haven't bumped up my spending to another bracket, I'm still shopping the same shitty, forgettable retailers rather than looking for places that would actually sell beautiful, high quality items that WOULD become my favorites.

Uniqlo,"If you're picky about your natural fibers, there's *sometimes* a difference between low-end and mid. GAP and J.Crew clued into the fact that certain consumers will pay more for anything that a sheep looked at. The wool (theoretically) makes the garment different and better, so mid-range retailers use more of it.

I’m not really defending this difference, though, because I think most retailers do the bare minimum re: their buzzwords. Bad-quality wool still pills, ""merino"" or “mohair” signal luxury but are used in stupid ways (seriously, hand-spinners and knitters know they have the wrong qualities to make hard-wearing socks), and I can't count the number of allegedly-wool items I've excitedly snatched up that turn out to be 82% Other Materials. 

The nonsense reached its height the other summer when everyone sold linen knit t-shirts and sweaters. Woven linen is terrifically hard-wearing and comfortable. It is my favorite material; I’ve literally sewed hundreds of yards of it. But knit linen is *stupid*. By the time you’ve washed it enough for it to break down so it’s soft as a cotton or hemp knit shirt, the seams will probably be unraveling, because the overlocking machines most manufacturers use to stitch knit fabrics are rarely set up to adequately bind the cut edges on linen. (I had a J.Crew linen tee that kind of... disolved.) Linen isn’t as elastic as other fibers, too, so the fabric stretches out faster and doesn’t bounce back under its own weight, making it a dumb choice for stuff like hanging cardigans. But the word “linen” says breezy summer luxury, so appropriate materials be damned!

I used to be a knee-jerk fiber snob— I was the consumer these retailers, with the bare-minimum value-added materials, were gunning for. But now I’m starting to think that I would rather have a nicely constructed cotton-rayon cardigan than an indifferently-made wool one. At least Uniqlo and Woolovers and L.L. Bean are still making sensible wool stuff, and there’s an infinity of good stuff left in thrift shops from before “natural fibers” got trendy.

Uniqlo,"What you said re: competing with internet sales is very insightful. I think that this is broadly a problem with a lot of reactions to brand! new! technology!—people forget how much the physical experience (e.g. of going to a store, being able to try things on, taking in the luxury or glamour of the store experience) matters to people, even if an online experience gives you more ""features"". I've definitely had situations where I was willing to buy an item in person instead of online for a markdown, just because the vibe of the store was better or I felt some sense that I could support a local business or participate in a physical community.

It's been really confusing to me seeing how J. Crew's pricing strategy has worked in the past few years. There's this disconnect between their aspirational brand image (which is kind of WASPy, ""classy"", high-quality staples, buying into an upper-middle-class kind of identity) and the things they end up producing. The J. Crew Collection stuff, for example, mostly sells extra quality and fashionable items (like skirts with sequins made of fancy jacquard). But I think it's alienating to see this new high-priced line that sells quality (isn't that what the rest of the J. Crew stuff supposed to have?). And I do think the people who are willing to pay designer prices aren't going to go to J. Crew for their expensive-slightly-impractical sequined skirt, and the regular J. Crew customer is sifting among wool sweaters and pants and worrying that the sweaters will be more pilly than last year, or the pants made of a thinner material.

It's interesting, but even if something at Gap or J. Crew is the same price as something at, say, Uniqlo, I feel a certain reluctance to buy it. Uniqlo doesn't discount things _that_ often, so I get this impression as a consumer that those prices are more honest and a better predictor of the exact quality I'm getting.

If you're shopping for linen in general, remember to look for words like ""flat felled"" or ""French seams""-- those phrases mean that the seams have been enclosed in some way, which will keep the fabric from unraveling. You *can* set up an overlocker machine to finish linen reasonably well, so French seams aren't mandatory, but those extra touches suggest that you've found a manufacturer who cares about (or cares about *looking* like they care about) construction and durability.",0.0949404761904762,0.3639880952380952,neutral
Uniqlo,"Sorry for the confusing terms. It sounds like you've got them mostly right-- a ""ply"" is interchangeable here with ""strand,"" so yours sounds like it's two-ply (made of two different strands), but I would call it all yarn. 

I would hesitate to answer what you should expect at that price point. The pilling *could* be a manufacturing defect, or it could be the designer making some deliberate choices. Using a higher-twist yarn could help the sweater resist pilling, but it might also feel a little ""harder"" or ""coarser"" on the skin, and it would give a different surface texture. Loosely-spun yarns made in soft, fine fibers can develop a ""bloom"" after they're washed or dry-cleaned (that delicate fuzzy ""halo"" you sometimes see on cashmere), but that effect doesn't invite durability. 

So it could go either way! If we're trying to build the ideal sweater that lasts forever without showing much wear, I would look for something handmade out of slightly thicker, twistier, coarser multi-ply yarn, knit into a dense fabric (you shouldn't be able to see light through it) in a varying pattern (not just smooth, unvaried stitches, but with things like honeycombs and cables and ribbing-- the variation makes the fabric denser and more resistant to pilling), with a yarn that doesn't have a fuzzy/halo'd surface. Unfortunately, this limits what your sweater can *be*: it'll be a little itchier, a little bulkier, and a little less ""neutral"" than a plain merino pullover. (Ours, as described, might look like [this LLBean sweater](http://global.llbean.com/shop/1912-Heritage-Sweater%2C-Fishermans-Cardigan/89934.html), which is a Definite *look* on its own, but dang does it look bombproof.) A couple companies (Uniqlo!) claim they're working on anti-pilling treatments for sweaters, but for now, we get to make trade-offs.

Thanks for the kind words! I'm having a slow weekend, so researching and writing these answers has been really fun.

And the frequent discounts at these chains, as advertised in constant emails promising 40% off for one day only, aren’t helping matters.

I'm really curious how other FFAers feel about this! I've personally felt this disenchantment with a lot of middle-market brands. A lot of my wardrobe now is Uniqlo (inexpensive, very standard, basic pieces) and then I'll occasionally spend more on a designer item (where I feel the quality is a huge step up or the style is particularly distinct and original and novel). J. Crew often doesn't seem interesting enough or high-quality enough to make me want to spend $120 on a sweater at MSRP.

There's also some speculation in the article on how the ""millennial generation"" (am I the only one that gets immediately defensive when news articles start generalizing about millennials?) may be prioritizing spending differently:

> “Unlike previous generations, millennials don’t need nor want three wardrobes: wear to work, recreation and going out,” Jaffe wrote in a Jan. 4 note. “The casualization of the workplace has ostensibly shrunk their closet and their apparel spending when compared to the prior generation. The millennials dress more individualistically and are less likely to conform and buy into a current trend, making it tougher for apparel retailers to offer product that appeals to them.”

I'm not sure if everyone is experiencing the ""casualization"" of the workplace, but I do feel that the internet has made it much easier to explore different fashion styles and subcultures and attempt to carve out your own niche.",0.09403935185185187,0.49158950617283953,neutral
Gap,"I would happily buy Gap and Banana Republic - but the quality has all gone to shit. I just dont trust them to sell me stuff worth the price. So I'll just spend 1/3 as much or less and get something the same or better, or twice as much and get something perfect.",0.3041666666666667,0.47395833333333337,positive
Gap,"I find it hilarious/sad that there's a banner ad being served at the very top of this article for Gap's current ""up to 75% off"" sale.

ETA actual comments:

I'm not so sure I agree with the overall thesis that millennials buy less clothing (measured in number of items) than prior generations. In fact, I think there are many more macro trends that would support the opposite hypothesis:

* E-commerce has made shopping a much more *frequent* activity for most people, as opposed to the big beginning-of-season shopping trips of yore.
* Fashion and retail trends move faster than they used to, partly in line with all cultural trends (no doubt related to the Internet and globalization) and partly because the path from runway to mall has shortened considerably - meaning things become ""dated"" more quickly and require replacement.
* ~Wardrobe overhauls~ and closet purging have become a more massive phenomenon than ever before, which prompts more shopping and more clothes owned over a lifetime as people constantly discard and replace things in a quest for the perfect wardrobe.

I think it's that last trend that is most ominous for mid-tier retail: we've started thinking about clothes as either Buy It For Life or cheap thrills, which leaves no role for anything in the middle. Clothes that are meant to last 1-3 years have basically no place in this ongoing fantasy of wardrobe optimization and permanence.",0.2505555555555556,0.38740740740740737,positive
Gap,"I have all but eliminated mid priced brands from my wardrobe. When examining vintage pieces (pre mid-90s) of clothing from brands like Gap, J. Crew, and the like - I am astounded at the durability and quality of the pieces. When I go into a mid-range store nowadays, I am struck by how poor the quality is, how unhelpful the store workers are on a whole, and I am basically underwhelmed by the whole experience. This has little to do with my millennial sensibility, but more to do with the fact that with the awareness that all the clothes, whether a $20 or $120 sweater basically come from the same factory overseas, paired with poor customer service (online and off) and meager selections in stores - all these things come together and keep me away from mid range retail.

Gap,"This makes me think of the last time I went into the Gap, I was returning a pair of jeans that I'd changed my mind about and the cashier said something like ""oh honey, you paid full price for these ?? They're 40% off now, do you still want them?"" This was only about two weeks later. I haven't got the mental energy necessary to pursue sales, and it's kinda crummy that jeans that cost $70 last week only cost $40 this week. I feel like if I hadn't returned them I would've basically been ripped off for $30. That doesn't give me that warm and fuzzy, can't wait to shop at the Gap again feeling. 

I kept one new pair, and they're noticeably thinner than the Gap jeans I still have from high school (which was over a decade ago). I know cuts change and stuff, but they fit differently too even tho they're supposedly the same cut. Differently in a bad way, they're just way less flattering than my old jeans. I really only kept them because I'd already worn them. They were on sale, at least.

I know I'm at the high end of the ""millennial"" generation, but I didn't leave you, Gap. You left me. Now where the heck am I gonna get jeans? Online, probably. Every other store in the mall plays pretty much the same game.",0.021719114219114224,0.44523892773892776,neutral
Gap,"I'm going to offer up an unpopular opinion: I shop at Gap quite frequently for basics and staples for my work and casual wardrobe. It's the one brand where I always know my clothing size so I can buy stuff online and 95% of the time it will fit exactly how I want it to. However, as a young adult, there are many items that they sell that I ignore because they remind me of my Mom's wardrobe or the materials are really off.

 I ALWAYS read reviews and am skeptical about products that have none at all (they definitely remove or refuse to post negative reviews of shitty products). I am happy to shop at Gap with a few basic rules/thoughts in mind: 1. If the material is largely synthetic, find something else 2. Do you like the color? Will you like the color in a different season or year? 3. Does it remind you of an item you would like from a more expensive store, e.g. Madewell (which matches most of my fashion aesthetic)? I view Gap as my favorite low-end rather than mid-range clothing store because when I compare prices and quality of items there versus stuff I've bought from Forever 21, H&M, etc. I like my Gap stuff way more and it lasts longer in terms of style and everyday wear. Plus, I NEVER buy their stuff full price because of the store's penchant for inflating ""regular"" prices. I typically wait for their stuff to go on sale to combine with 40% off sales so I buy clothes from their for 50-75% off, making the product prices comparable to fast fashion retailers.

Lastly, I do have to be really picky about what I buy. I don't have a Gap in my town so I order online and send back about 1/4 of what I purchase (but luckily their free returns and quick refund policies make this easy). I feel like despite all of these caveats, I'm happy with my Gap clothes because it means that I can have more clothing which matches my aesthetic for a cheaper price. I'm not at a point in my life where I can splurge on a $100+ item more than a couple of times a year so Gap fits my current wardrobe needs. 

tl;dr Gap doesn't totally suck, it's just necessary to change your perspective about how to effectively shop there if your fashion identity aligns most with Madewell (like mine).",0.18164924506387922,0.5141584025730367,positive

I know what to look for, I can distinguish between a well made piece of clothing and a piece of crap. I have gone into Forever 21, Gap, old navy, Aeropostale etc and gotten so irritated at the price and quality that I just gave up. No one is making clothes to last.

Gap,"I don't think I've ever bought anything from the Gap or the mid-price retailers in the article. I find Gap's stuff is too plain, I'm very monochrome and need prints to spice up my look. Macy's and Anthropologie aren't in my area, J.Crew just opened last year, and Banana Republic was always my ""when I make real money"" aspirational store.

My family struggled financially when I was growing up, and as a pudgy, bookish, unattractive child, I never had much that was fashionable. When I went to university I shopped mostly at department stores (Zellers, Wal-Mart) with a few outlet pieces.

After graduating, all of my business casual finds were from thrift stores - in keeping with budget and my lack of career progress. Also, honestly, you can commit more fashion sins at 20 than 30. I went back to school and into a casual/athletic wardrobe phase that aligned with my next career.

Now that I'm old and matronly-looking, I'd prefer to buy pieces that fit well (or can be altered), and don't make me look like mutton dressed as lamb - i.e. are age-appropriate for the early 2000s aesthetic I'm most comfortable wearing. 

Winners/Marshalls has been my go-to store for those finds, where several brands can be chosen from and I don't have to sift through a whole store to find one cardigan style. Given that I don't even know where I'd go to have clothing altered, that's not really an option for places that are almost-but-not-quite right. It's very annoying to walk into a store and find nothing at all, which is often the case for super-fashionable places.

At the end of the day, it's just clothing. It'll shrink in the wash, get stained, start to unravel, or fall out of style before you know it. While I love the pieces I've had around for 10+ years, I applaud the rise of affordable stuff that can serve its time and move on as the seasons change.

Gap and J.

Customers come into the store, they look at the new merchandise, and they look at the prices. They like the merchandise, but don't like the price, and so they don't buy. As a result, this new merchandise sits on the shelves. The first markdown takes place after six weeks, and only then does the merchandise begin to move. So for six weeks, not much happens. You're wasting your real estate and capital. Johnson comes in and says we're not going to play this game. Why not sell at $50 right away?

People always talk about small towns being ""a year or two behind"" in fashion, and this is partially why. Buying the newest thing just isn't practical, especially at full price. The other thing that I see a lot of is there is still a lingering reluctance toward online shopping. I'm much more likely to hear of people going to a physical store than buying something on a flash sale. And, where I'm from, the 15 minute drive to Target and Kohls is preferable to the 1.5 hour drive to a mall where you'll find BR and J. Crew. No one has heard of Aritzia.

Gap,"**tl;dr** bc I got too excited by this question—I don't think it's unreasonable to expect high quality. There are lots of dimensions of quality and I think it basically comes down to knowing what materials and types of items you can buy frugally (not many designer jeans will be substantially higher quality than generic Levi's). A lot of discussion on clothing items ""falling apart"" is overhyped, imo—and it partly has to do with our false expectations for what durability we can actually get at a certain price, and there are lots of ways to care for clothes to help them last longer.

—

> So, are we at a time now where it is unrealistic to expect clothing to last and be high quality?

I'm actually reminded of a great FFA thread from two years ago—[""Where is the middle ground between fast fashion and designer prices?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/189plz/where_is_the_middle_ground_between_fast_fashion/)—which is possibly related and you might find it interesting. To your question, I really don't think quality has entirely evaporated from the market, but there are a ton of cultural/market tensions that mean:

* a lot of clothing sold is fast fashion, which is produced on a very short cycle and meant to make money at volume because the prices are so low—none of this stuff is _meant_ to last, it's just an unexpected bonus if it does
* consumers are inured to rock-bottom prices and many of us, quite honestly, aren't buying stuff that has the margins/capability to be high-quality anyway, and we have artificial expectations on what quality we can actually expect
* because of the price pressures on retailers to keep prices low, have good sales, &c &c, clothing prices haven't risen in tandem with inflation + increasing material costs, so there are costs being cut _somewhere_, and often in material/construction quality

I can dig up stats on this if you'd like, but in the past few decades American consumers have spent a lower %age of their income on clothing than we did in the past. So when people talk about the good old days with higher-quality clothing, I often suspect that:

* people were paying more for clothes back then
* the concept of fast fashion and disposable clothing didn't really exist
* selection bias—only the solid, well-made clothing is still here with us today

So I think in many ways FFA can veer towards being overly cynical and overly demanding of the garment industry today. I really think this is an issue where we're being sold a bill of goods (high quality garments bought new at Gap that reflect Gap's storied legacy) that isn't actually true (the quality isn't there because the price is too low to do better). It could also be, of course, that retailers are just trying to milk as much money out of consumers as possible, but I think that many mid-market retailers _know_ that people want better quality—they are just unable to provide it at the price, or have (in some cases) deduced that people can have a very vague sense of what quality means to them.

To be honest, it's quite possible for lots of items (even fast fashion ones) to ""last"", too, depending on what you mean. It varies so much:

* H&M cotton tank dress I've owned for about 4 years — I maybe wear it 30 times max in a year, I wash it cold and hang dry (like all of my clothes), and it hasn't pilled at all.
* acrylic blend Gap sweater I bought 4 years ago and ""lasted"" half a year — shrunken and warped after washing it once. Sweaters (especially acrylic ones) do badly with machine washing and _horribly_ after machine drying!
* Madewell denim shorts I've owned for a year and a half — maybe 100 wears at this point? I don't think anything's really changed about them.
* Urban Outfitters skinny jeans — the dye washed out (they were black and turned a dark blue) after a year (maybe ~100 wears?) and the knees got incredibly threadbare.

I think there are lots of dimensions of quality and lots of ways in which things degrade. Levi's jeans and Gap jeans are pretty inexpensive and sturdy (imo, paying more—e.g. $150 for a pair of jeans—doesn't get you substantially better quality). A lot of items straight up are not meant to last (if you wear a t-shirt regularly, it will absolutely pill at high-friction areas). A lot of items need better care to survive longer (machine-drying is brutal on clothing! leather should be cleaned and conditioned!).",0.05127561327561327,0.4678641489229724,neutral
Gap,"If you're picky about your natural fibers, there's *sometimes* a difference between low-end and mid. GAP and J.Crew clued into the fact that certain consumers will pay more for anything that a sheep looked at. The wool (theoretically) makes the garment different and better, so mid-range retailers use more of it.

I’m not really defending this difference, though, because I think most retailers do the bare minimum re: their buzzwords. Bad-quality wool still pills, ""merino"" or “mohair” signal luxury but are used in stupid ways (seriously, hand-spinners and knitters know they have the wrong qualities to make hard-wearing socks), and I can't count the number of allegedly-wool items I've excitedly snatched up that turn out to be 82% Other Materials. 

The nonsense reached its height the other summer when everyone sold linen knit t-shirts and sweaters. Woven linen is terrifically hard-wearing and comfortable. It is my favorite material; I’ve literally sewed hundreds of yards of it. But knit linen is *stupid*. By the time you’ve washed it enough for it to break down so it’s soft as a cotton or hemp knit shirt, the seams will probably be unraveling, because the overlocking machines most manufacturers use to stitch knit fabrics are rarely set up to adequately bind the cut edges on linen. (I had a J.Crew linen tee that kind of... disolved.) Linen isn’t as elastic as other fibers, too, so the fabric stretches out faster and doesn’t bounce back under its own weight, making it a dumb choice for stuff like hanging cardigans. But the word “linen” says breezy summer luxury, so appropriate materials be damned!

I used to be a knee-jerk fiber snob— I was the consumer these retailers, with the bare-minimum value-added materials, were gunning for. But now I’m starting to think that I would rather have a nicely constructed cotton-rayon cardigan than an indifferently-made wool one. At least Uniqlo and Woolovers and L.L. Bean are still making sensible wool stuff, and there’s an infinity of good stuff left in thrift shops from before “natural fibers” got trendy.

Gap,"What you said re: competing with internet sales is very insightful. I think that this is broadly a problem with a lot of reactions to brand! new! technology!—people forget how much the physical experience (e.g. of going to a store, being able to try things on, taking in the luxury or glamour of the store experience) matters to people, even if an online experience gives you more ""features"". I've definitely had situations where I was willing to buy an item in person instead of online for a markdown, just because the vibe of the store was better or I felt some sense that I could support a local business or participate in a physical community.

It's been really confusing to me seeing how J. Crew's pricing strategy has worked in the past few years. There's this disconnect between their aspirational brand image (which is kind of WASPy, ""classy"", high-quality staples, buying into an upper-middle-class kind of identity) and the things they end up producing. The J. Crew Collection stuff, for example, mostly sells extra quality and fashionable items (like skirts with sequins made of fancy jacquard). But I think it's alienating to see this new high-priced line that sells quality (isn't that what the rest of the J. Crew stuff supposed to have?). And I do think the people who are willing to pay designer prices aren't going to go to J. Crew for their expensive-slightly-impractical sequined skirt, and the regular J. Crew customer is sifting among wool sweaters and pants and worrying that the sweaters will be more pilly than last year, or the pants made of a thinner material.

It's interesting, but even if something at Gap or J. Crew is the same price as something at, say, Uniqlo, I feel a certain reluctance to buy it. Uniqlo doesn't discount things _that_ often, so I get this impression as a consumer that those prices are more honest and a better predictor of the exact quality I'm getting.

Gap,"> I was returning a pair of jeans that I'd changed my mind about and the cashier said something like ""oh honey, you paid full price for these ?? They're 40% off now, do you still want them?"" **This was only about two weeks later.**

I think this kind of thing does feel really frustrating and like a betrayal as a consumer. It makes _sense_ to me that if I buy something at the very beginning of fall at MSRP, someone else can buy it for half the price 3 months later. In that situation I generally go, ""well, the time I was able to wear it until it went on sale is worth paying the extra money"".

If it gets marked down soon after I buy it, I tend to either get angry at myself (for not timing my purchases to sales better!) or annoyed at the company.

As far as jean thicknesses go, I don't disagree that Gap could be cutting costs, but I also wonder if the flimsiness of clothing is also attributable to skinnier (and necessarily stretchier) jeans. With tops, for example, there are few womenswear brands who do really sturdy thick cotton t-shirts, but I think many people are also looking for a style that drapes better—which requires thinness. It's hard to disentangle what is a retailer following trends vs a retailer pushing certain consumption patterns for their own convenience.

Gap,">> I think it's that last trend that is most ominous for mid-tier retail: we've started thinking about clothes as either Buy It For Life or cheap thrills, which leaves no role for anything in the middle. Clothes that are meant to last 1-3 years have basically no place in this ongoing fantasy of wardrobe optimization and permanence.

I'm the opposite - this is completely not true for me. All I want is clothes that will last a couple of years!

At this stage in my life (grad student) I don't have a lot of disposable income to spend on designer, buy it for life, items, but I also don't want to spend a lot of time and energy replacing items as they wear out. I'm also aware that my tastes will probably shift over time, which is another reason not to buy ""investment"" pieces. 

I just want to buy a solid pair of jeans that will survive my thighs longer than a year so that I can buy new jeans because I want a different style rather than because they have holes in. Ditto things like simple tops and t shirts - I want items that will remain smart enough for work, without major pilling or stretching, for long enough for my tastes to change. 

I basically buy everything from Uniqlo now, and certain things from H&M because I've had good luck with some items in the past and at least they're easy to replace.

Madewell,"I'm going to offer up an unpopular opinion: I shop at Gap quite frequently for basics and staples for my work and casual wardrobe. It's the one brand where I always know my clothing size so I can buy stuff online and 95% of the time it will fit exactly how I want it to. However, as a young adult, there are many items that they sell that I ignore because they remind me of my Mom's wardrobe or the materials are really off.

 I ALWAYS read reviews and am skeptical about products that have none at all (they definitely remove or refuse to post negative reviews of shitty products). I am happy to shop at Gap with a few basic rules/thoughts in mind: 1. If the material is largely synthetic, find something else 2. Do you like the color? Will you like the color in a different season or year? 3. Does it remind you of an item you would like from a more expensive store, e.g. Madewell (which matches most of my fashion aesthetic)? I view Gap as my favorite low-end rather than mid-range clothing store because when I compare prices and quality of items there versus stuff I've bought from Forever 21, H&M, etc. I like my Gap stuff way more and it lasts longer in terms of style and everyday wear. Plus, I NEVER buy their stuff full price because of the store's penchant for inflating ""regular"" prices. I typically wait for their stuff to go on sale to combine with 40% off sales so I buy clothes from their for 50-75% off, making the product prices comparable to fast fashion retailers.

Lastly, I do have to be really picky about what I buy. I don't have a Gap in my town so I order online and send back about 1/4 of what I purchase (but luckily their free returns and quick refund policies make this easy). I feel like despite all of these caveats, I'm happy with my Gap clothes because it means that I can have more clothing which matches my aesthetic for a cheaper price. I'm not at a point in my life where I can splurge on a $100+ item more than a couple of times a year so Gap fits my current wardrobe needs.

Madewell,"**tl;dr** bc I got too excited by this question—I don't think it's unreasonable to expect high quality. There are lots of dimensions of quality and I think it basically comes down to knowing what materials and types of items you can buy frugally (not many designer jeans will be substantially higher quality than generic Levi's). A lot of discussion on clothing items ""falling apart"" is overhyped, imo—and it partly has to do with our false expectations for what durability we can actually get at a certain price, and there are lots of ways to care for clothes to help them last longer.

—

> So, are we at a time now where it is unrealistic to expect clothing to last and be high quality?

I'm actually reminded of a great FFA thread from two years ago—[""Where is the middle ground between fast fashion and designer prices?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/189plz/where_is_the_middle_ground_between_fast_fashion/)—which is possibly related and you might find it interesting. To your question, I really don't think quality has entirely evaporated from the market, but there are a ton of cultural/market tensions that mean:

* a lot of clothing sold is fast fashion, which is produced on a very short cycle and meant to make money at volume because the prices are so low—none of this stuff is _meant_ to last, it's just an unexpected bonus if it does
* consumers are inured to rock-bottom prices and many of us, quite honestly, aren't buying stuff that has the margins/capability to be high-quality anyway, and we have artificial expectations on what quality we can actually expect
* because of the price pressures on retailers to keep prices low, have good sales, &c &c, clothing prices haven't risen in tandem with inflation + increasing material costs, so there are costs being cut _somewhere_, and often in material/construction quality

I can dig up stats on this if you'd like, but in the past few decades American consumers have spent a lower %age of their income on clothing than we did in the past. So when people talk about the good old days with higher-quality clothing, I often suspect that:

* people were paying more for clothes back then
* the concept of fast fashion and disposable clothing didn't really exist
* selection bias—only the solid, well-made clothing is still here with us today

So I think in many ways FFA can veer towards being overly cynical and overly demanding of the garment industry today. I really think this is an issue where we're being sold a bill of goods (high quality garments bought new at Gap that reflect Gap's storied legacy) that isn't actually true (the quality isn't there because the price is too low to do better). It could also be, of course, that retailers are just trying to milk as much money out of consumers as possible, but I think that many mid-market retailers _know_ that people want better quality—they are just unable to provide it at the price, or have (in some cases) deduced that people can have a very vague sense of what quality means to them.

To be honest, it's quite possible for lots of items (even fast fashion ones) to ""last"", too, depending on what you mean. It varies so much:

* H&M cotton tank dress I've owned for about 4 years — I maybe wear it 30 times max in a year, I wash it cold and hang dry (like all of my clothes), and it hasn't pilled at all.
* acrylic blend Gap sweater I bought 4 years ago and ""lasted"" half a year — shrunken and warped after washing it once. Sweaters (especially acrylic ones) do badly with machine washing and _horribly_ after machine drying!
* Madewell denim shorts I've owned for a year and a half — maybe 100 wears at this point? I don't think anything's really changed about them.
* Urban Outfitters skinny jeans — the dye washed out (they were black and turned a dark blue) after a year (maybe ~100 wears?) and the knees got incredibly threadbare.

I think there are lots of dimensions of quality and lots of ways in which things degrade. Levi's jeans and Gap jeans are pretty inexpensive and sturdy (imo, paying more—e.g. $150 for a pair of jeans—doesn't get you substantially better quality). A lot of items straight up are not meant to last (if you wear a t-shirt regularly, it will absolutely pill at high-friction areas). A lot of items need better care to survive longer (machine-drying is brutal on clothing! leather should be cleaned and conditioned!).",0.05127561327561327,0.4678641489229724,neutral

You might be a Millennial with an outdated wardrobe. 
 
 

It’s not a sin - if you still feel fun, fresh, and comfortable in your wardrobe, that’s cool, and feel free to click away. No one’s taking away your skinny jeans. 
 
 


If, however, you’re wondering how to update your wardrobe, make it feel a little fresher, and look more current, then you’re in the right place. 
 
 


The important thing to know is that a wardrobe update doesn’t mean that you need to throw away all your clothes and start over - unless that’s what you desire. You can update some key pieces and restyle some old ones in order to refresh your wardrobe and keep up with the times. 
 
 


The other thing to keep in mind is that wanting to be more current, and updating your wardrobe doesn’t mean you need to dress like a teenager. Nor does wanting a current wardrobe mean you’re desperately trying to look 20. It’s about being interested in style and wanting to remain current, stylish, and even - god forbid - trendy. Being interested in fashion and wanting to look modern isn’t just for the kids.  
 
 








#Step 1 - Skinny jeans
 







 

We all know why you’re here, skinny jeans and your cold dead hands. Skinny jeans have become somewhat of a security blanket for a lot of people. It was the dominant silhouette for so long, and a lot of our wardrobes have been created around that. However, just like your college boyfriend, just because it’s comfortable and you met them when you were 20, it doesn’t mean you’re married to them until you die. 
 
 










##Keeping your skinnies
 










Of course, no one is forcing anyone to give up their skinny jeans. Contrary to popular belief, the trend police will not break into your house to take them away, and your cold dead hands are safe, they needn’t be deployed. If you’re not going to replace them, then you can use a different styling approach. Styling them the same way you have been for 15 years will inevitably feel stale and old-fashioned. But that can be remedied by making some changes and tweaking other elements in your wardrobe. 
 











If you’re wearing skinny jeans,
 

##Don’t do this:
 
 






These are examples that *together* create looks that can feel a little stale, old-fashioned, and less than fresh. Just like skinny jeans, it doesn’t mean that you have to throw away these things, but maybe don’t style them together, in the exact same way you did in 2010. 
 





 

###1 Low/mid waist









 
Example: [low rise look](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201634/rs_634x1024-160404113513-634.Lauren-Conrad-Lo-Rise-Skinny-jeans.jl.040416.jpg?fit=around%7C776:1254&output-quality=90&crop=776:1254;center,top) 
 
 






Well, what’s wrong with low/mid-rise? And wait, isn’t low rise coming back in style? Yes, it is. Just not in skinny jeans. When the pants style changes (every 15 to 20 years), that usually brings a change in silhouette. In this case, we have moved from skinny bottom, oversized top, to skinny top, oversized bottom. 
 










In that case, wearing a slim, cropped shirt and low-rise, wide-leg pants is an outfit with a nice balance, that is meant to emphasize the midriff. Wearing the same cropped outfit with low-rise skinny jeans throws off the visual balance and just ends up looking like you’ve outgrown your clothes because both elements are tight.
 









Seeing as tucking a shirt in or wearing a more cropped, boxy top is currently in style, that also poses a problem with mid or low rises, because they are [very awkward to tuck into](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5460/30851893355_a148f001a1_o.jpg). 










Once again, it disrupts the proportions and the visual balance. Tucking into low or mid rise skinny pants forces a 50/50 proportion that is both unnatural and not out of left field enough to be avant-garde. It’s [just awkward](https://www.herstylecode.com/2021/04/how-to-style-low-rise-jeans-low-rise-jeans-outfit-ideas-for-women_herstylecode-1.jpg). 
 
 







###2 Tunics/long sweaters

 







Example: [tunic top look](https://www.puttingmetogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maroon-tunic-leopard-scarf-fall-outfit-03-2-scaled.jpg)
 





 


Again, an issue of silhouette. Wearing skinny jeans with a tunic is probably your comfort zone, and while there’s nothing wrong with that, it’s not going to read as modern or stylish. If that’s your goal, then I’d avoid pairing skinnies with any kind of long top. 










“Skinny jeans and a nice top” can still be your go-to, but consider updating the style of the top. A top with more structure and more waist emphasis will read more modern than a long, loose, shapeless top. If you’re still keen on covering the derriere, then a boxy, oversized sweater or top with structure is a fresher alternative. 
 






###3 Thin long cardigans








 
Example: [look with long cardigan](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/c1/24/79c124f9856b1b5e0e9503de421c234d.jpg)
 









 
Cardigans made out of thin materials have never been especially flattering, because they tend to cling. It also makes it difficult to layer underneath them. The slimmer and thinner the cardigan, the bulkier the layers under it. A long, unstructured cardigan over skinny jeans is also an outdated silhouette. There are still duster cardigans out there, but they’re heavier, chunkier, and a little more oversized, occasionally with a tie waist. They allow layering and look more structured and less boho. 
 
 






###4 Ballet flats



 




 
Example: [ballet flat outfit](https://jljbacktoclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Janis-Lyn-Johnson-Talbots-Denim-Shirt-Louis-Vuitton-Speedy.png)
 
 









Grab your tutus, ballet flats are actually coming back into fashion. But paired with skinny jeans, the look is straight out of 2010. Thin soles and light, “nothing”-type shoes are definitely not the freshest style (yes, that includes Rothys, but that’s a conversation for next time), but they can still be passable with a more modern pants cut - preferably something straight or wide leg, and cropped. [The new ballet flats](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/ballet-pumps-ss23) are also more dance-inspired, with specific detailing, so the round toe Tory Burch flats from 2008 are not exactly cutting edge. 
 
 








###5 Low ankle boots

 








 
Example: [low ankle boots outfit](https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/vest-turtleneck-skinny-jeans-large-36449.jpg)
 







 
Like ballet flats, the time of low ankle boots has come and gone. Once, skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s, now it’s just what middle-aged moms wear out to date night at Cheesecake Factory. And there’s nothing wrong with any of that! But the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier. The Cheesecake Factory regulars won’t know what hit them.
 
 





###6 Tight knee high/OTK boots






 
 
Example: [OTK boots look](https://www.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13.-With-Skinny-Jeans-And-Knee-Length-Boots.jpg)
 







 
I know skinny jeans and slim over the knee boots go together like peanut butter and jelly. And they did - for years and years. Which is precisely why that particular combination will read as dated. You can still keep both, just change up the styling, and don’t pair them together. Knee high boots are back in style, but instead of a 2010s slim riding boot, it’s [a wider, more generous cut with a chunkier sole](https://sheerluxe.com/sites/sheerluxe/files/styles/square_small/public/articles/2021/10/chunky-boots-trend-hero.jpg?itok=rJyQxw3y). The OTK boots can also still be worn, but rather with a mini skirt/dress, a slim midi skirt, or a pair of winter-weight shorts, like leather or tweed. 
 
 




###7 Graphic tees

 






 
Example: [graphic t-shirt look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0225/2669/articles/starshell_birthday_girl_birthday_outfit_birthday_gift_247941b9-86e8-431e-bffd-173b156bc815_2048x.png)
 
 







If anything in your house or wardrobe says “Live, Laugh, Love”, I urge you to get rid of it immediately. Same with any saying related to coffee or the word “vibe”. You’ll thank me later. 
 








Now, I’m not saying you can’t wear graphic t-shirts with skinny jeans. I’m saying the type of graphic t-shirt has changed a lot over the last 15 years. The slim fit, tiny sleeve crew neck t-shirts with flowery Etsy font is dead, you can downgrade it to the shirts you wear when you’re cleaning or painting. So is the thin, loose, cropped, 80s t-shirt that says “Bridesmaid”. 
 








Instead, an oversized and boxy, OR straight fit t-shirt is [the more modern and current option](https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1674890613_542_Levis-CEO-says-skinny-jeans-are-brands-biggest-sellers-despite.jpg). Neither long nor short, neither wide nor tight, a comfortably loose t-shirt with a regular short sleeve is a perfect basic, non-offensive choice for any woman of any age. If it has to have a graphic, make it a band tee. Not something that says “Namaste”.

I cannot wear low rises at all (they slip right off my straight hips) so I pretty much stopped wearing jeans in the 2000s. 

I love high rise and find them to be the most comfortable (even though I'm short) and most flattering. And I really like high rise skinny jeans as they suit my figure. But I've always been a sucker for a dramatic flare and have indulged on and off whenever they were a fringe trend.

These are examples that *together* create looks that can feel a little stale, old-fashioned, and less than fresh. Just like skinny jeans, it doesn’t mean that you have to throw away these things, but maybe don’t style them together, in the exact same way you did in 2010. 
 





 

###1 Low/mid waist









 
Example: [low rise look](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201634/rs_634x1024-160404113513-634.Lauren-Conrad-Lo-Rise-Skinny-jeans.jl.040416.jpg?fit=around%7C776:1254&output-quality=90&crop=776:1254;center,top) 
 
 






Well, what’s wrong with low/mid-rise? And wait, isn’t low rise coming back in style? Yes, it is. Just not in skinny jeans. When the pants style changes (every 15 to 20 years), that usually brings a change in silhouette. In this case, we have moved from skinny bottom, oversized top, to skinny top, oversized bottom. 
 










In that case, wearing a slim, cropped shirt and low-rise, wide-leg pants is an outfit with a nice balance, that is meant to emphasize the midriff. Wearing the same cropped outfit with low-rise skinny jeans throws off the visual balance and just ends up looking like you’ve outgrown your clothes because both elements are tight.
 









Seeing as tucking a shirt in or wearing a more cropped, boxy top is currently in style, that also poses a problem with mid or low rises, because they are [very awkward to tuck into](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5460/30851893355_a148f001a1_o.jpg). 










Once again, it disrupts the proportions and the visual balance. Tucking into low or mid rise skinny pants forces a 50/50 proportion that is both unnatural and not out of left field enough to be avant-garde. It’s [just awkward](https://www.herstylecode.com/2021/04/how-to-style-low-rise-jeans-low-rise-jeans-outfit-ideas-for-women_herstylecode-1.jpg). 
 
 







###2 Tunics/long sweaters

 







Example: [tunic top look](https://www.puttingmetogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maroon-tunic-leopard-scarf-fall-outfit-03-2-scaled.jpg)
 





 


Again, an issue of silhouette. Wearing skinny jeans with a tunic is probably your comfort zone, and while there’s nothing wrong with that, it’s not going to read as modern or stylish. If that’s your goal, then I’d avoid pairing skinnies with any kind of long top. 










“Skinny jeans and a nice top” can still be your go-to, but consider updating the style of the top. A top with more structure and more waist emphasis will read more modern than a long, loose, shapeless top. If you’re still keen on covering the derriere, then a boxy, oversized sweater or top with structure is a fresher alternative. 
 






###3 Thin long cardigans








 
Example: [look with long cardigan](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/c1/24/79c124f9856b1b5e0e9503de421c234d.jpg)
 









 
Cardigans made out of thin materials have never been especially flattering, because they tend to cling. It also makes it difficult to layer underneath them. The slimmer and thinner the cardigan, the bulkier the layers under it. A long, unstructured cardigan over skinny jeans is also an outdated silhouette. There are still duster cardigans out there, but they’re heavier, chunkier, and a little more oversized, occasionally with a tie waist. They allow layering and look more structured and less boho. 
 
 






###4 Ballet flats



 




 
Example: [ballet flat outfit](https://jljbacktoclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Janis-Lyn-Johnson-Talbots-Denim-Shirt-Louis-Vuitton-Speedy.png)
 
 









Grab your tutus, ballet flats are actually coming back into fashion. But paired with skinny jeans, the look is straight out of 2010. Thin soles and light, “nothing”-type shoes are definitely not the freshest style (yes, that includes Rothys, but that’s a conversation for next time), but they can still be passable with a more modern pants cut - preferably something straight or wide leg, and cropped. [The new ballet flats](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/ballet-pumps-ss23) are also more dance-inspired, with specific detailing, so the round toe Tory Burch flats from 2008 are not exactly cutting edge. 
 
 








###5 Low ankle boots

 








 
Example: [low ankle boots outfit](https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/vest-turtleneck-skinny-jeans-large-36449.jpg)
 







 
Like ballet flats, the time of low ankle boots has come and gone. Once, skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s, now it’s just what middle-aged moms wear out to date night at Cheesecake Factory. And there’s nothing wrong with any of that! But the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier. The Cheesecake Factory regulars won’t know what hit them.
 
 





###6 Tight knee high/OTK boots






 
 
Example: [OTK boots look](https://www.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13.-With-Skinny-Jeans-And-Knee-Length-Boots.jpg)
 







 
I know skinny jeans and slim over the knee boots go together like peanut butter and jelly. And they did - for years and years. Which is precisely why that particular combination will read as dated. You can still keep both, just change up the styling, and don’t pair them together. Knee high boots are back in style, but instead of a 2010s slim riding boot, it’s [a wider, more generous cut with a chunkier sole](https://sheerluxe.com/sites/sheerluxe/files/styles/square_small/public/articles/2021/10/chunky-boots-trend-hero.jpg?itok=rJyQxw3y). The OTK boots can also still be worn, but rather with a mini skirt/dress, a slim midi skirt, or a pair of winter-weight shorts, like leather or tweed. 
 
 




###7 Graphic tees

 






 
Example: [graphic t-shirt look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0225/2669/articles/starshell_birthday_girl_birthday_outfit_birthday_gift_247941b9-86e8-431e-bffd-173b156bc815_2048x.png)
 
 







If anything in your house or wardrobe says “Live, Laugh, Love”, I urge you to get rid of it immediately. Same with any saying related to coffee or the word “vibe”. You’ll thank me later. 
 








Now, I’m not saying you can’t wear graphic t-shirts with skinny jeans. I’m saying the type of graphic t-shirt has changed a lot over the last 15 years. The slim fit, tiny sleeve crew neck t-shirts with flowery Etsy font is dead, you can downgrade it to the shirts you wear when you’re cleaning or painting. So is the thin, loose, cropped, 80s t-shirt that says “Bridesmaid”. 
 








Instead, an oversized and boxy, OR straight fit t-shirt is [the more modern and current option](https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1674890613_542_Levis-CEO-says-skinny-jeans-are-brands-biggest-sellers-despite.jpg). Neither long nor short, neither wide nor tight, a comfortably loose t-shirt with a regular short sleeve is a perfect basic, non-offensive choice for any woman of any age. If it has to have a graphic, make it a band tee. Not something that says “Namaste”.

Her brand is so fun, delicate, sweet and precious. I was quite surprised about her decision to put it into the hands of H&M and do a collaboration with them. Sure, the paycheck must have been massive and it gives her access to a broader clientele and some cool talent such as Nara Smith.

H&M,"Collaborations with large conglomerates like H&M are always a bit of double edged sword. I can understand why someone like Magda would do it though. Outside of a small fashion bubble, she has little to no name recognition, meaning her message won’t reach very far. 

Sure, it has some impact on the authenticity of what she is trying to achieve through her work but it also gives opportunities to show that brands like H&M are in fact capable of doing better. Depending on how fast this sells (and if it sells out), it also tells H&M that doing better gets you more/new customers. 

Also, fashion is cutthroat. If she doesn’t find a way to stay relevant and in people’s minds, she won’t survive and her message will be lost or usurped by someone else.",0.18389880952380952,0.5139550264550264,positive

>I've had to make some tough decisions about not buying the trendy thing I wanted simply because I can't afford to drop that kind of money on something that might be outdated in a couple of years. 

Indeed if you want to ""buy it for life"" you can't be all surprised Pikachu face when it looks outdated in 10 years. But I think you can buy well and stay satisfied with the item for the long haul if you're confident and curious enough to try styling it in new ways/pairing it with different things to freshen it up as trends change.

No and no, I'm finally stable in my career and living situation and my hobby is clothes lol so I buy more now than before I was into fashion.

I was frustrated recently because I had to go to a wedding for the first time in a while and my formal options were: a black floor length dress (formal enough but wearing black to a summer wedding is a bit somber) or a white dress with flowers that was definitely too white for a wedding. I ended up buying a new dress that I've only worn once thusfar.

Gap,"I kind of accidentally started doing a low-buy at the start of 2022 due to the quality of clothes declining, but I still bought clothes second-hand. Then I started a very intentional no-buy in October 2023 (I haven't been perfect with it, but I've killed my pre-2022 shopping habit). I was planning on ending the no-buy in October this year, but I genuinely have no interest in buying new clothes anymore. In the last three years, when I've really wanted something, I've gone out of my way to get it second-hand or handmade. Examples:


- I identified a gap in my wardrobe that was knee-high black boots. I scoured the internet until I found what I wanted on eBay.


- Another gap in my wardrobe was a super wide belt. I found a maker on Etsy and my partner gifted me two of their belts.


So to answer your question, I plan on continuing this way of shopping. I know a lot of people shop this way already, by purposefully identifying an item and then finding the best match, but before 2022, I never did that. I'd wander into a store and pick something I liked. 


I don't need any more clothes. However, there will always be an item that I'll want that will satisfy my itch for a trend or replace an item I've worn through or fill a gap in my wardrobe that I wasn't aware of before.

So, when I was a teen back in the 1990s, I bought all my own clothes while working a minimum wage job for $4.25 an hour. I wear size 12 shoes and am a tall, so I was severely limited in what I could buy. Generally I bought Gap jeans for about $50 a pair and shoes from Nordstrom for about $100-$120 a pair. Jeans cost me 12+ hours of work.

Two weeks ago, I bought a few pairs of jeans from Gap for $31 each. I bought Naturalizer shoes for $70.  Where I live now, minimum wage is $12.50 an hour. Jeans cost less than 3 hours of work. 

All this complaining about clothing being too expensive shows a lack of knowledge about how incredibly CHEAP clothing is now. If those pants had kept pace with inflation, my Gap jeans would be over $100 now and similar shoes would be $200+.  

I do relate to the frustration with polyester and fake fibers, especially as someone who feels sick wearing them. I buy LL Bean, Gap, and other such sweaters. They aren't super cheap, but they are cheaper compared to similar sweaters in the 1990s.",-0.042884199134199136,0.5154166666666666,mixed

Gap,"It is. This take is a little weird. If you were buying jeans in the 90s for $50 a pair from Gap, or $100 shoes from Nordstrom, you had income to spare. Unless you were wealthy, maybe that was your one pair that were to last a while.

The vast majority of people could not afford that yearly. Gap was considered expensive to most. In the 2000s, Levis were being priced at $50 each, and they were more expensive than other jeans that you could get at those middle retailers like JC Penney. Now, we are more used to these prices.

Companies like Nordstrom and conglomerates like LVMH discovered that they make more money targeting all classes of people rather than being exclusive to the wealthy, however brands have also done a lot of work with prices and keeping them at -just- a level where people afford it.

They can only do this, and keep raising profit margins, by lowering quality and mass producing.

There has definitely been a reduction in clothes quality at the high price points, but I'm not sure it's happening at lower price points.

Madewell,"Great post. The decline in quality with increase in prices is so real. Right now, I'm trying to go for quality over quantity and split between indie brands/etsy and buying basics from JCrew and BR. However, it's annoying when my tees from four years ago are clearly better than my recent purchases. 

My buying journey over the past 8-9ish years has taken me from luxury to indie to mid to everywhere else. Here are my thoughts and experiences on quality and price increases.

I think of my buying ideology as divided between two phases: 2015-ish to 2019 and post-Covid. In the before Covid phase, I was lucky to get a great job out of graduate school and prioritized high quality luxury purchases I'd buy on deep sale from sites like Farfetch, Net-a-porter, Saks, Barney's Warehouse, etc. I could find Saint Laurent, Valentino, Chloe, and similar at like 70-80% off if I was patient enough. I wore my clothes to work and for going out so the cost per wear felt justifiable. I also fell into brands like Doen, Christy Dawn, Sezane, and Reformation, as well as some Theory, Maje. When I was in school, I wore Hollister, PacSun, Express, etc., and I could tell the difference in quality. 

Then in 2020 to 2021-ish, I worked from home during lockdown and had to deal witha bunch of non-Covid health issues. I stopped buying luxury clothes and for the first time invested in higher end lounge wear. I also bought a bunch of clothes from JCrew, Madewell, and BR that I could machine wash easily and excessively because I turned into a germaphobe. I actually liked my purchases and thought the quality good for the price. 100% cotton tees and linen shirts. Cute sweater jackets. Jeans I liked as much as my pairs from Chloe and YSL. JCrew summer cotton dresses became preferred over my Reformation linen ones, as the quality of Ref seemed to be lower than before. 

Then in 2022-2023, I thought it was time to return to my old shopping habits as I was back at work in person full time and going out again. However, the luxury market was out of control with prices while the quality had gone downhill. I also noticed the sales seemed stingy (or maybe I was too busy or unmotivated to stalk giant markdowns like I did before). Even when on sale, the discounted prices seemed outrageous to me, especially when comparing the quality of the pieces I already owned or vintage items I acquired. So I stucked to my indie brands, found some etsy sellers who make custom dresses, and continued to buy basics from JCrew and BR. 

2024: Needed more loungewear. Due to my sensitive skin, I prefer 100% cotton, and almost all the brands are blends these days. I realize that's fine for most people, but I need cotton or linen. On top of that, the brands that still do 100% cotton are charging highway robbery. I can still find good deals for basics at JCrew and BR, but the quality is noticeably less than even two years ago. I do prefer JCrew's jeans now over Madewell's. My indie brands and etsy remain my MVPs, although occasionally I get irked by some of the sheer/unlined pieces at Christy Dawn and Doen at their price points. Haven't returned to luxury except to buy vintage or maybe a random piece. It also doesnt help having now read about all the shady practices/price markups these brands have. My pre-Covid clothes still fit and look good, although idk what will happen when (fingers crossed) I'm pregnant in the near future...

Anyway, I don't have an easy answer. All commercial brands seem worse quality from high to low. Indie and etsy are good, but the former is still pricey. Quality basics at reasonable prices seem to be an endagered species.",0.1570155993431855,0.4773029556650247,positive

You'd really have to be living under a rock not to know about it already.

However, some people always claim to be shocked and outraged by this type of thing and some might even boycott H&M for a time. I think it's just too uncomfortable for people to acknowledge that fashion in itself is an unethical hobby in the vast majority of the cases. If you want to keep buying trendy clothes, buy dresses for 20 dollars or have 5+ pairs of jeans in your closet then this is the way things are going to be.",-0.15714285714285717,0.7857142857142857,negative
H&M,"**Disclaimer and TL;DR:** I wrote this a bit tongue in cheek and just threw my thoughts on the screen so it's a bit all over the place. I went full circle, realising there is no way I could fully boycott fast fashion and its many tendrils without almost completely opting myself out of fashion as a hobby.

=====

My gut reaction would be ""of course!"". Maybe for a few months I will steer clear of fast fashion, but eventually I'll forget about the news and go there again if I need something.

It's such a complicated problem because if you decide for example ""I'm going to boycott major fast fashion labels"", where do you draw the line? Should I also tick off brands that are owned by the H&M group even if they're better quality and claim to vet their manufacturers for ethical working practises? What about higher end brands that use the same factories as H&M? How could I even find out? What about brands that use factories owned by the businesses that own H&M's factories? What about brands that aren't as open about who they use for manufacturing? What about so called ethical brands? Can they *really* guarantee that every step of their supply line is ethical and has the lowest possible impact on environment?

Basically, I would feel like a hypocrite to boycott H&M while still buying any kind of fashion for, well, *fashion* instead of for the pure need to clothe myself. Even thrifting is creating a need for fast fashion because I'd be buying it, just via second hand.

And even if I could buy my entire wardrobe from places like People Tree, Elizabeth Suzann, Eileen Fisher... There's the problem that some of these brands are quite expensive, even more so when shipping them to UK. Also, it feels pretty wasteful to have, say, a single pair of trousers shipped all the way from America (shipping by air is incredibly polluting too) just so I can have some new clothes. For that price I should probably have a pair of trousers made by the local tailor. (But again, where is the fabric coming from?)

And I haven't even considered yet how I would have to revamp my entire personal style to make do with the rather specific aesthetic of ethical brands. And I honestly don't even know where I'd start looking for ethical underwear and socks in UK.

In conclusion, I think fashion as a whole is just a bad hobby to get into. I look up to bloggers like Unfancy and Style Bee who have beautiful personal styles that for the wast majority are ethical... But it is not a cheap style to have, and for someone living on the other side of the pond not at all feasible to re-create without sometimes turning to brands that can't be labeled or verified as ethical. Still, I have admiration for style bloggers who base their blog and style around the focus on sustainable and ethical fashion when traditionally the whole idea of a style blogger is the antithesis of responsible consumption. It is playing the game on hard mode.

Personally what works for me is buying less and making do with what I've got. If I really want to refresh my style, I buy something expensive and high quality (so I can't afford to buy many things). But I honestly don't know if my favourite labels (Acne Studios, Isabel Marant, Me and Em, AllSaints, Toast, Frye etc.) are any more ethical or less morally compromised than H&M, the deeper the supply chain you dig...",0.11194955044955046,0.5293666333666334,positive

Personally I have faith in their way of working. When they say that they have reason to burn these clothes, I believe them. Why would they burn perfectly normal clothes? I makes no sense. They could have just donated it and that's also what they do normally if there has been wrong labels in it, that makes the clothes unsellable. 

What the investigation shows, I have no idea. I have no idea why their results of their tests differ from H&M's own, but I just can't see what's in it for H&M, just getting rid of clothes that are fine to donate. 

Also I know how many initiatives they take in donating and recycling and it's not just a little. I have never gotten a hint that something in that area was supposed to be hidden or not spoken of. I also know that on the factories they use to produce their clothes, they will try and use their company size to teach them about a good work environment, having decent salaries, decent work conditions and everything. With the, relatively small, amount of information I have about them, I have no shame in saying that I work there. 

Furthermore I think that programs like Operation X will always be able to find something to dig into that, from the outside, looks sketchy, especially in a huge company like H&M.

My point is that I don't think we need to go out and buy new clothes as much as we think we do; therefore, cost and convenience doesn't really justify fast fashion. 

For most of my life, I keep about 3-4 pairs of jeans in my closet at a time, and it takes about 3-5 years for one pair to fall apart. I would only really need to buy a new pair every two or every other year. I don't buy high end jeans either, my jeans tend to cost around $20 to $40. I could be wrong, maybe some people's clothes do fall apart a lot more faster.

Fast fashion is the way it is because we keep buying them at the rate they are being produced. I've been cutting back on buying clothes for other reasons the last two years, and I don't feel like I am short of anything because I already bought plenty before.

Look up the Builders Labourers and the Green Bans of the 70s if you're interested in a good example of this sort of thing- through a very well planned selective strike/boycott, the residents and union members forced big urban developers in Sydney to stop razing local landmarks and preserve historical sites.    

Plus, the illusion of choice is basically shattered when you think about the social economic situations a lot of these corporations encourage (in the US at least). If you work for Walmart, they lobby state government Republicans to oppose minimum wage increases and support union busting/anti-organizing tactics. You get paid $8 an hour and have no health insurance and can get fired at any time because they constantly change your schedule and sometimes you have to pick your kid up from school. How are you supposed to be able to make ethical choices about where your clothes come from in this situation? If you buy the $5 shirts and sweatshop underwear from Walmart is that really your fault for supporting shitty fast fashion retailers? You don't have many choices, and you need to wear clothes.

Some seemed like honest (if dumb) mistakes (a children's sheriff badge in low resolution looked like holocaust prison shirt). 

I used to be ok w/ wearing Zara if I found it used, but in general avoid fast fashion sources (not perfectly). I am wondering if some of these actions besides the discrimination suit (the low oversight over design, design thievery, and mass sweat shop conditions) are worth singling out one company for when F21, H&M, UO etc have similar track records, and its the industry thats a problem.

There was no where to sit in the break room other than the floor because they didn't buy any chairs. If it took more than 30 mins to tidy the shop after closing, you were expected to stay until it was done and weren't paid for it (if I remember correctly, this  was actually in the staff  and book too) On a Saturday night, this could take several hours, which you were expected to out in for free. No one was ever given their legal break entitlement (where I'm from that is usually 20 mins every 6hrs- though most companies I have worked for are 20 mins every 4 hours), or shift patterns in line with the working time directive. I quit the day the store manager called me on my day off and asked me if I would come in as they were short staffed. When I got to the store, she pulled me up in front of everyone for not coming into work when I was meant to. I pointed out I'd come in to do her a favour, and wasn't meant to be in at all that day.

Zara,"When I read posts such as yours, I am reminded of two things. One, Zara is just one of the myriad retailers with a shady business model--you mentioned that as well but I want to add online-only retailers who offer even cheaper goods with the same fashion copy-paste mentality and a pinterest photo of garment (not even the real thing.) Two, that behind the scenes there is a lot going in such large companies.

To start Zara is owned by Inditex. Inditex owns the following: Zara, Zara Home, Mango, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti, to name a few. When a company is so large and the demand to put more and more goods on the floor is so fast you “cannot” dedicate much time to the design process that would happen at the head office. Per division they would have fashion designers, graphic designers, fit & spec technicians, production coordinator, and other people who make the process happen. This is a standard set up of any design company and each garment must. touch the hands of all those people. The process of getting a garment to you (store level) from the first planning of a collection is about a year for most non-Zara retail model. Zara can make that happen in about 4 months. With that said steps are cut form the process. For example, pre-washing fabric is a “waste of time” and that’s why your garment shrinks or twists after the first laundry you do. The pattern should have been cut on fabric only after washing it at least once. The company did not have time too see a sample in all sizes, so they may not fit how they should, but production time is more important.

I hold Zara liable for not taking serious action for what has happened. But if you are a graphic/fashion designer working for them the “demand” and time restrain makes it very easy to use existing graphics and styling without batting an eyelash. No fast fashion can be 100% creative because this would greatly increase the garment development time. To find something on the runway and copy it is also a way to know your garment will sell. The majority of customers want what they have already seen. This is key in the design world now. Corporate has little care for creativity and more for profit. People want to look like runways and instagram models.

All to say, Zara will keep running if people continue to buy from them. Every other company such as H&M, forever21, TOPSHOP, Aritzia, etc. etc. are on the exact same area of design copy, lack of diversity, unethical practices. Fashion led me to fully express and find myself. I just wish that the acceptance and inclusion I felt could translate in the corporate world, where people would actually matter and exploiting people would be seen as negative. It’s kinda ridiculous to have “ask for that” but corporate greed is so hungry they will pay to shut down the controversies that have made it to our ears.",0.0777538029100529,0.4355076058201057,neutral

I am confused how it's Zara's fault Melania Trump wore an item of theirs in a way that was a bit strange? Is it the retailer's fault if I wear a t-shirt that says 'best day of my life' to a funeral? That doesn't seem like a Zara controversy to me, but a Melania Trump controversy. 

Most of the other controversies, whilst more directly involving Zara, seem a bit far fetched to me.

H&M,"I first heard about Zara's questionable practices on this subreddit (workers sewing in pleas for help). the most recent flotus jacket controversy apparently has unearthed a pretty long track record of...at minimum, questionable business practices including pepe-frog-like designs, and actions leading to $40mil lawsuits from its one corporate lawyer for discrimination for being Jewish and gay. Some seemed like honest (if dumb) mistakes (a children's sheriff badge in low resolution looked like holocaust prison shirt). 

I used to be ok w/ wearing Zara if I found it used, but in general avoid fast fashion sources (not perfectly). I am wondering if some of these actions besides the discrimination suit (the low oversight over design, design thievery, and mass sweat shop conditions) are worth singling out one company for when F21, H&M, UO etc have similar track records, and its the industry thats a problem.

(2) Lawsuit claiming pretty terrible and gross discrimination practices among employees. https://thebeatdfw.com/2783276/former-zara-executives-lawsuit-reveals-companys-discriminatory-practices/

Do you guys think about this a lot when building your wardrobes? I will probably not only not buy more (used) zara but probably get rid of all the zara stuff i have just because i feel gross about it and can't enjoy wearing it anymore. I'm skeptical how much individual consumer action impacts anything, but its just i kind of feel repulsed and can't enjoy the items anymore.

H&M,"I wrote my PhD dissertation on the politics of fashion, and this exact subject was at the center of my discussion.

What I found in interviewing people is that even the most conscious folks I spoke to (other PhDs studying political issues, for example) did not think too much about the conditions that created the clothes they purchased and wore. And many vaguely realized that there were bad working and living conditions for those in the developing world making their garments, but that did not stop people from shopping at H&M or Urban Outfitters. Most defined their apparel purchasing habits in terms of their personal aesthetic style, and managed to divorce their overall look from their own political ideologies.

When pressed to consider the garment factory fires that have killed thousands, the sweatshops that hire children and force people to work long hours, the big corporations brazenly stealing designs from independent designers, and the lack of living wages for workers .... there was a silent shame that overcame most, and an acknowledgment that they could be more aware of these things.

If I took anything away from speaking with consumers, it's that even the most conscious of them feel powerless. They WANT to purchase fashions made that support workers and treat them well. But they don't know how to find them, and are surrounded by only fast fashion. They simply can't afford the stuff that's not made in sweatshops, or do not know how to identify the stuff that is not.

However, the responsibility cannot be placed solely on consumers to only buy products made responsibly. The change has to be top-down. The government needs to offer giant tax relief incentives to companies to create quality working conditions and offer good pay for garment workers, whether their products are US-made or outsourced to another country. And there has to be stringent regulation of the production process, regardless of where a company's clothes are made, if they are to be sold in US retail stores, whether online or brick-and-mortar.",0.0930952380952381,0.4259183673469388,neutral
H&M,"When I read posts such as yours, I am reminded of two things. One, Zara is just one of the myriad retailers with a shady business model--you mentioned that as well but I want to add online-only retailers who offer even cheaper goods with the same fashion copy-paste mentality and a pinterest photo of garment (not even the real thing.) Two, that behind the scenes there is a lot going in such large companies.

To start Zara is owned by Inditex. Inditex owns the following: Zara, Zara Home, Mango, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti, to name a few. When a company is so large and the demand to put more and more goods on the floor is so fast you “cannot” dedicate much time to the design process that would happen at the head office. Per division they would have fashion designers, graphic designers, fit & spec technicians, production coordinator, and other people who make the process happen. This is a standard set up of any design company and each garment must. touch the hands of all those people. The process of getting a garment to you (store level) from the first planning of a collection is about a year for most non-Zara retail model. Zara can make that happen in about 4 months. With that said steps are cut form the process. For example, pre-washing fabric is a “waste of time” and that’s why your garment shrinks or twists after the first laundry you do. The pattern should have been cut on fabric only after washing it at least once. The company did not have time too see a sample in all sizes, so they may not fit how they should, but production time is more important.

I hold Zara liable for not taking serious action for what has happened. But if you are a graphic/fashion designer working for them the “demand” and time restrain makes it very easy to use existing graphics and styling without batting an eyelash. No fast fashion can be 100% creative because this would greatly increase the garment development time. To find something on the runway and copy it is also a way to know your garment will sell. The majority of customers want what they have already seen. This is key in the design world now. Corporate has little care for creativity and more for profit. People want to look like runways and instagram models.

All to say, Zara will keep running if people continue to buy from them. Every other company such as H&M, forever21, TOPSHOP, Aritzia, etc. etc. are on the exact same area of design copy, lack of diversity, unethical practices. Fashion led me to fully express and find myself. I just wish that the acceptance and inclusion I felt could translate in the corporate world, where people would actually matter and exploiting people would be seen as negative. It’s kinda ridiculous to have “ask for that” but corporate greed is so hungry they will pay to shut down the controversies that have made it to our ears.",0.0777538029100529,0.4355076058201057,neutral

H&M,"Anyone else noticing both the quality and designs of Gap going way downhill? This was the first time I bought anything there in years and I remember I used to love Gap back a few years ago, 2013-2017. They had great deals and also pretty good quality for a mall store, and I bought my (still) favorite pair of jeans there and need to keep replacing them from Poshmark because they're discontinued. Plus the styling back then was modern and basic with a twist, Gap kept up with some of the trends but was much more subdued than H&M or Forever 21. But today when I went in there, most of the jeans felt kind of stiff and not soft at all, and you could see that the stitching was more noticeably spaced out. The shirts, tees, and dresses all looked uninspired and very mass-produced and thin/scratchy, almost indistinguishable from Old Navy. And overall, nothing seemed very current or fashionable - everything seemed to be in that drab medium blue, slub fabric in boring or frumpy cuts that I'm convinced don't look good on anyone (i.e. notch neckline with pleats, tops with exposed drawstrings, etc.). Additionally if you showed me any particular item and said it was from 5 years ago, I would have believed you. Even the tags and labels looked as boring as possible, like they don't even try anymore to pretend that you're buying clothes from a boutique and not from a warehouse driven by sweatshop-labor.

H&M,"I think a couple things happened (I worked at Gap in the late 90s and early 2000s FYI) 

After the recession, stores got scared to take chances. The adorable enamel pins, skinny sequin scarves, bright corduroy peacoats and print tops with beaded details? OUT. Basic stuff that felt very unisex and safe was in. Well, so did every other mall store and Gap no longer felt unique and lost its voice. I always felt Gap was 60s and 70s influenced American sportswear. Preppy with a slight twist. It felt like they were going in the same direction as American Eagle, Aeropostale, Ann Taylor, etc. It just felt bland and middle of the road. 

The death spiral started. Not enough sales means hours cut and fewer people on the floor. Fewer people means disorganized and chaotic sales rooms/rounders and longer lines, and stores that felt empty and had no energy. That keeps people away and you get less sales. Even less hours to go around. Even crappier store upkeep. 

A Gap in an otherwise busy and luxury/high end mall I visited had two people working there: one was wearing pilled, faded leggings as pants and a grateful dead (!!) novelty sweater. When I worked at Gap it was Gap clothing or Gap-alike only and we were given generous discounts and incentives to dress the current styles. I recall being told to ""retire"" tired looking tees as a teen or being gently told something wasn't quite up to par. I'm sure the store managers and leaders have way, way bigger fish to fry now. 

Sales. Customers expect near continuous cycle of sales now. Because Gap, BR, Old Navy, Ann Taylor, etc run a near constant 40-50% off sale, no one is paying full price anymore. So cash flow for fabric, workers, finishings, notions, and patterns is less. 

Gap and many other stores have cycled through a bunch of heads of design trying to find a voice/look. I can recall when Rebekka Bay was brought in and seeing her vision and thinking ""uh-oh"".

There seemed to be an alchemy or magic about Gap in the late 90s but that was before the real surge of social media.

There’s a lot of basic stuff (linen or cotton button ups or popover shirts, basic jeans, basic pants, sweaters, Ts) plus some cuter things like dresses.

Their silhouettes are not as up to date on all items as they could be, but there is a variety of stuff that works well.

Sure enough, she wound up [leaving after a short stint](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jan/30/gaps-creative-director-rebekka-bay-leaves-after-less-than-a-year)

There seemed to be an alchemy or magic about Gap in the late 90s but that was before the real surge of social media. Social media created this world where there's a demand for niche looks, highly trendy looks, statement looks, and highly photogenic, unique, and branded, easily recognizable looks. A basic Gap tee really isn't that different from Uniqlo, Muji, H&M, or any other of thousands of retailers. Compare that to the inconic designer looks that dominate social media---you know a Gucci Dionysus bag when you see one, right? Same with a Supreme branded sweatshirt. Conformity and looking like everyone else is no longer a goal. Being mainstream and inoffensive with a slight pinch of salt/spice feels dated and none too youthful. 

I miss Gap and I miss being able to pop in there and pick up a handful of cute tees or some cool and trendy jeans. I miss working there! But yeah, it's not the same.",0.11161007025761123,0.4422703616965912,positive
Gap,"Gonna lead with an unpopular opinion here, but Gap is pretty decent for its price point. There’s a lot of basic stuff (linen or cotton button ups or popover shirts, basic jeans, basic pants, sweaters, Ts) plus some cuter things like dresses. I bought a pair of high rise crop flare jeans yesterday and they are really cute. The denim is pretty sturdy (high-ish cotton percentage) which i like. There are some cute linen crop flares right now. I shop at the gap fairly often and the quality is generally higher than H&M or F21, in terms of stitching and cut and fit. Plus, whoever the hell is their size 4/27 fit model is my body twin, so I can order things online and count on them to fit me well. It’s not going to win any edgy fashion prizes, but it’s good wardrobe staple stuff for me. Their silhouettes are not as up to date on all items as they could be, but there is a variety of stuff that works well. 

Sweatshop labor? Yes, it’s big international company. They basically all do that to some extent. Am I comfortable with that? No. Best solution? Quit shopping so damn much, but I never seem to accomplish that goal.",0.24184265010351969,0.5159730848861284,positive

This is true for most outlets. One time I was eyeing a thin leopard scarf at Banana Republic, saw the same one at the outlet but noticed the material is cheaper when I looked at the tag. It looks identical but instead of a wool blend, it was synthetic. Nothing wrong with synthetic, it's less fussy than wool and cheaper--but the price needs to reflect that! The thing I hate about outlets is that they aren't even priced that cheap for the quality. There's a sale everyday, and the MSRP prices are the same as the non outlet stores but with inferior quality. Even at the 40% off prices, for what you're getting, I wouldn't say it's a steal but people are sucked into thinking it's a great deal and thinking that these items are higher quality leftovers or from past seasons. Back in the day they used to be but now outlets just operate like any other store with it's own styles manufactured specifically for them (outlet). I'd in fact say the 40% off price should be the MSRP, that seems more fair. I find I get better stuff buying at the non outlet during a good sale, things will even tend to be cheaper than the outlets sometimes.

H&M,"I dunno, I worked at H&M through a lot of their designer collabs, and as a fashion designer myself I have to say the quality was typically quite good for the price.  At least the $300 dresses have silk blends and stuff, whereas I could go to Nordstrom and find an enormous number of $300 dresses that are 100% polyester and shoddily made.  Don't forget that H&M has enormous buying power, they can typically make stuff at a substantially lower price than any high end designer, it's just that what they're usually making is an $8 tshirt.

I'd say, at least in the area I was working, the bigger problem is that the designer collections don't jive with their typical customer base, so you get an initial rush of buyers on the opening day, and then as you return to regular clientele, they don't have an interest in those kind of styles, and a huge amount of the clothes end up getting shredded.  But don't let the name brand put you off, the fabric and finishing is typically above average for the price range.",-0.038947368421052626,0.5193117408906883,mixed

Like, I would rather spend $100 on a vintage Prada skirt than bother with an equally priced cashmere sweater from J Crew, which will probably be made of the lowest quality fibers.

H&M,"The unfortunate reality is that there is no middle ground for retail prices. Most of these midrange brands, such as Madewell, J Crew, and Reformation, are fast fashion. Sure, if you look hard enough, you can score some hidden gems. But for the most part, $100 top at J Crew will honestly be the same quality as the $15 version at H&M. This is because consumers truly underestimate the labor, time, and costs that go into garment production. For example, a beautifully crafted puff sleeve dress with lace detailing and organic materials can easily retail for 800+. So that $150 version you bought at Free People is like the equivalent of buying $5 Airpod knock-offs from Temu. But in the case of Free People, you spent $100+ for the name, not the quality of the piece.

So, your only alternative is to shop for designer and high-quality vintage wares in the second-hand market. There, you'll maximize quality whilst staying on budget.

Uniqlo,"It's fun seeing what others do with their wardrobe apps! I'm also a longtime user (I've had YourCloset since 2018) and I aim for several of the same goals.

Regular clothes, I try to get them down to $1CPW, if they are a bit more fancy (like suits and cocktail dresses) then I aim for $5/CPW and keep them in rotation for date nights and special events instead of buying new.

The only alarming stat is the ""total value of closet"".   It says $25,039.   though makeup and jewelry and shoes are included in what I track, so that makes slightly less alarming.  I thrift and buy a lot of secondhand, but record what the ""replacement"" value of the clothes for insurance purposes because I hunt for some seriously vintage and limited edition stuff and you only have to have one wildfire near miss to make you paranoid AF (I live in British Columbia and it is a tinderbox in the summer).

H&M,"Is J. Crew really all that much better than H&M? I'm pretty sure both are considered fast fashion brands and run into the same issues of quality. I love J. Crew clothes (it's cute preppy! It's my soft-masc jam tbh).

The truth is that I have less patience with H&M because the stores are colossal and overwhelming (and often too trendy for me at this point), but I would argue that in terms of fabric quality alone, there are certainly good pieces, but the cost is your time. 

For example, people are quick to tout Aritzia on here as incredibly high quality, even though most of their fabrics are 100% polyester (I've been told it's 'good quality polyester' when I pointed this out--though I have come across no writing that says some polyesters are better than others, I took their word for it, but now I wonder why I did). A similar top in H&M is as likely to be 98% polyester to less than that (a cotton-poly blend, for example). From all the cues on good/bad stitching and construction I've seen some pretty shitty pieces in J. Crew and I have a good number of awesome H&M things from years to almost a decade ago--no pilling (some softening for the decade dress), great stitches. I go into stores and I still see that sort of stuff tbh.

I think all these brands can be hit or miss. Hell--I walked into a fancy schmancy store a couple days ago on 5th Ave and they had a branded tee that was pretty awful.

With all of these brands: J. Crew, Gucci, H&M we are paying for the brand, and all the tee shirts will be equal (mediocre) quality\*. At least, that's what I've seen. If they're not paying for the name itself--(and J. Crew as a name had a lot of power when I was a teen, not just with my preppy teen peers, but their parents)--they're paying for the ambience. Aritzia stores feel very cool, exclusive and fun (and sometimes the people there are sweet as pie to me and sometimes they are incredibly dismissive and gatekeeping-y, depending on if they think I can afford it) but I'm still not sure they're ever worth full price.

In part, my exposure to FFA has made me think about this sort of thing more. I've noticed that though quality stays the same, people name the same brands over and over--and because so many people say this I do think of those brands as better than I might have considered them if I went in and felt around. There is definitely a bias on this sub towards the more expensive--admittedly much less so than most fashiony things (blogs, magazines, etc.), but it's still there. 

I will also admit that some things look much better in terms of design/prettiness--especially in pictures. H&M stores don't look or feel pretty and their online models stand in front of a regular background and look at you. Very generic and accessible (which is the aim!) but Reformation has more interesting photos and the stores are cute and built in the very current minimalist-chic way. Is my marlowe dress really all that better than a similar slip dress at H&M? Probably not--in fact I know for a fact that H&M dresses don't pill or have loose threads after one or two wears. But does it *look* like it'll be better because how it's presented? Absolutely. 

I'm not saying H&M is the bestever thing btw--it's just a brand that is disparaged a lot that I'm not sure is all that bad (I mean, in terms of ethics every brand I've mentioned is pretty bad--some folks may argue against Ref about that, fine)--some of it just stems from classism. Tbh, I didn't like them much before because their sizing was crazy confusing and going into H&M (and similarly sized stores) is truly exhausting (even their website is somehow exhausting), but are other brands doing better? I don't think so.

\*Honestly LL Bean was the only place where I felt like there was a real visible difference with this. But I don't know if I actually like LL Bean's clothes so what can you do.",0.18959063615709185,0.5442656604998375,positive

H&M,"Honestly I feel like H&M is really picking up their game. They have some good quality inexpensive options and they have been making an effort overall as a company to be more environmentally conscious. I wear professional clothing daily and 5 years ago I moved away from H&M because of perceived low quality. In the interim I’ve shopped primarily Banana Republic Factory(Outlet/Discounted), J Crew Factory (Outlet/Discounted), and Nordstrom Rack. The J Crew clothing I found to be more expensive and lower quality than the banana. Nordstrom’s Rack had good options especially at sale times. Banana ended up being the majority of my professional wardrobe. I recently visited an H&M in while traveling in Europe and I was surprised by the difference from what I remember at American stores. They seemed to have higher quality clothing than before. I bought two shirts just to test them out and they have quickly become favorites, I have since gone online and bought more in different colors. One thing to think about with H&M is they have such a breadth of options that it is easy to get weighed down in the sections you don’t like. This is why I strongly prefer online shopping for places like H&M, you can filter to your exact size and only look through the sections you are interested in. I also always look at the fabric, tags can be kind of hard to find in store but online the fabric % is always listed beneath the photo which I find very helpful. Viscose blends often feel like silk without the difficult laundry or increased wrinkles. Also H&M has free online returns if you order enough which I like as I shop infrequently and usually in bulk.",0.1500750750750751,0.5012762762762764,positive

One, a lot of those J Crew-level brands are not great quality either, *for the price*. They may be better than H&M but you will still find thin fabrics that are sheer where they shouldn't be, pill easily, or stretch out / roll up in the wash (like hems rolling out of shape). You just have to be extra careful about what you buy, and pay attention to how different fabrics from different brands behave over time. If t-shirts from LOFT look great for three wears and then look pretty sad... probably don't trust t-shirts from LOFT anymore (yes that's a real example :P).

Two, you can experiment with those higher end brands through Nordstrom, which has free shipping & free returns for online orders, and a pretty generous return window! I have a few go-to online retailers: Zappos for shoes & purses, Nordstrom for anything experimental or (hopefully) high quality, and REI / Backcountry / Steep & Cheap for outdoor clothes (those don't have free returns but I'm more likely to know the brand's fit because I stick with just a few specific brands).",0.15913690476190476,0.635654761904762,positive

I currently can't afford much but not only do I like the idea of higher-quality clothing but I am very much into clothing that is more ethically and sustainably made. This can add up in the price department. That being said, I find that the clothing I purchase from Ethical brands often is higher quality than something that is more expensive in traditional retail. Traditional retail (most of what you see at the mall) is marked up super expensive just because of the label and to make a major profit. More ethical brands may still be expensive but often give you more bang for your buck (quality). I'm not sure if this answer is what you are looking for, but start doing searches for Ethical Brands and you may find what you're looking for. If you've been looking at J. Crew, I'd suggest Everlane.

H&M,"It really depends on the store. Honestly I think straight up donation thrift store thrifting at Savers, Salvation Army, etc, has gotten a lot worse since online secondhand shopping took off. It’s just so picked over by professionals, and probably also people selling their clothes to services like buffalo exchange or Thread Up that pay. With the next level up—buffalo exchange, uptown cheapskate, second time around, beacon’s closet—it has a lot to do with where you are located. I’ll shop at those kinds of stores when I visit NYC and LA, but where I live (Austin) those types of stores are mostly urban outfitters and ASOS, basically just skew very young because of UT. If probably have better luck in Houston or Dallas. Then there are high end secondhand and vintage stores, which again are geographically specific. E.g. there are a few high end vintage sellers and shops in Austin that are amazing, but high end secondhand is lacking. When I was in Milan for the summer, it was the opposite. There wasn’t much in the way of affordable/wearable sizes vintage, but you could get Prada and Ferragamo for under 100 euro.

Most of my secondhand stuff I buy online, mainly poshmark because the search functions for brands and sizes are user-friendly. For poshmark I search by brands I like, then filter by my size and surrounding sizes. With European brands I don’t use the size filter because there is no conversion yet it seems (eg poshmark things a 34 is super plus sized and not a FR extra small). Poshmark also lets you post or ask the seller questions, so you can get exact measurements and fabric content. You can also haggle prices like eBay. Occasionally I’ll do searches that are more specific and look at all brands, like “linen midi skirt,” “silk velvet dress,” “art nouveau,” or “Egyptian print” and then look at everything. That’s actually how I found one of my favorite (Dries Van Noten) skirts, and it only cost me ~$35. 

I wear a large size for vintage (30-34-inch waist depending on my bloat and broad bust/shoulders), so I basically just try on everything in my size and then buy what works if I like and can afford it. You can buy vintage from Etsy too, but it’s hard to sort through and people tend to either lie or not know specifics. So I usually avoid it unless it’s the Etsy shop of a brick and mortar store that I have visited in-person.

When I used to shop thrifty thrift stores more, I would touch everything to feel for fabrics like silk, merino, cashmere, angora, wool. I would avoid most polyester and also cotton and linen that felt really rough. I also collected a lot of 1980s-1990s rayon floral dresses and rompers, which have sadly become a hot commodity and hard to find in my old places. I usually gravitated toward vintage and kept an eye out for brands that I liked or knew were good quality (Anthropologie, Free People, Eileen Fisher, ll bean, vintage Levi’s, Patagonia). Occasionally I found designer pieces or nice department store (Neiman Marcus, Barney’s) house brands. I don’t generally recommend thrifting shoes unless they are new/deadstock or quality leather boots. I have some amazing thrifted boots and just replaced the insoles. 

Sadly most of my rayon vintage dresses disintegrated (I never bothered to dry clean), but 4-8 years later I still have an adorable 1990s cotton floral dress, two pairs of leather boots, bowling shoes, a merino wool brooks brothers cardigan, a vintage (1980s?)wool and angora double breasted coatigan, two 1970s-80s abstract pattern cotton blend tops, a 1990s acid wash denim jacket, some silk scarves, silver southwestern jewelry, and a Free People cotton summer dress. All this stuff has lasted and worked through many iterations of weight loss and gain. Most of it was from the three neighborhood thrift stores where I lived in Chicago. One top/sweatshirt is 11 years old from a thrift store in Portland, OR. So yeah if you search you can find stuff for pretty cheap that looks cool and lasts much longer than current H&M.

i feel like all clothes are getting so cheap (even the expensive stuff) that im paralyzed with indecision on whay to buy.

i used to buy old navy jeans. i had my size and knew it and could order online or in store without trying on. now even several pairs of the same size same style jean arent all exactly the same so i have to take them into the fitting room and figure out which pair fits right. 

i am honestly going crazy about clothes in recent years. i keep wearing “athleisure” on the weekends bc none of the damn jeans or anything i have fit right anymore so ive given up. id be willing to shell out a lot for clothes that i loved and could make use of for years like some stuff ive had, but literally 90% or more of the stuff i think i like and take home, fails me.",0.04456075533661741,0.5343596059113301,mixed

I’m also a huge fan of Banana Republic, Gap, and Old Navy. BR is obviously the most expensive of the 3 and also the nicest, but Gap is cheaper and still quite good quality clothing. All 3 have really great sales and very often - multiple times a month they’ll have like 50% off plus an additional 10% off sales and stuff like that. I also have a Banana Republic credit card from which I get anywhere between $25 and $75 store rewards (redeemable at any of their brands) each month, and I always get an additional 10% at BR. Wouldn’t necessarily recommend cards like that since they typically have higher interest rates, but if you pay it off each month the rate doesn’t really matter, and for me it’s great cause if I save up my rewards and wait for a good sale, I can spend less than $100 on clothes that would full price have been about $1,000 - not even an exaggeration.

Gap,">I don't think it's a stage in life thing so much as a stage in capitalism thing. 

I feel pretty similarly. I don't make a lot of money, but am also at a point where I don't need to purchase much. I want to like my clothes more than I need to build a wardobe on the cheap. I'm not really into clothes or fashion that much, and I'm certainly not a stylish or trendy person. Yet, I still have extreme emotional reactions sometimes when I'm shopping and I realize how quickly quality has deteriorated in ""mid market"" brands. I used to look forward to being able to afford to shop at some of these stores. About 2 years ago a J.Crew store near me closed and gave away $20 off coupons. I literally couldn't find anything to spend the money on; anything decent would have required more money to finish paying for than was worth it. This year I was so excited to see some clothes I liked and that seemed to be made decently there that I went way, way overboard and blew a ton of money there. It's still not what it once was, but I've found some pretty acceptable pieces. 

BR is unrecognizable. For a company that built its brand around the safari/field work aesthetic, they don't really carry much in natural fabrics anymore.

I read this article comparing Uniqlo to Imea and thought it was an interesting comparison. I can definitely see how the Uniqlo model matches up better with a store like Ikea than with any other clothing retailer that I can think of. They're both the store I check first when I need ""a basic X,"" and they both tend to have ""solution"" items that solve a specific problem. Although I definitely think of the latter as being an Ikea thing more than a Uniqlo thing, once the article put the idea in my mind I feel like it's really true--it's always the place I see recommended as ""try their ultra stretch pants if you have fit troubles"" or ""try heattech if you need warm but thin winter layers"" or ""try airism if you..."" and so on, you get the idea. 

That said, I've never has a significant fight with an SO over a sweater, so there's that.

Uniqlo,"I think that this is a brilliant comparison, and that as Uniqlo becomes more ubiquitous in the US, it could be the IKEA of clothing. As of now, it's more of an online niche for most of the country- though there are brick and mortar stores in certain urban locations, I'd argue that stores like Gap (with BR and Old Navy), Target, and JCrew still fit the 'go-to basics' stores for most of the Country.

However, I think there's something to be said about both Uniqlo and IKEA being distinctly 'foreign' companies- it certainly can add to the appeal. Your basic bookshelf is now 'Swedish', and the basic tee is 'Japanese'. It's a sensibility that works well with American values- obviously, made in America is a great sell, but having foreign based companies that embrace the difference makes for a feeling of participating in another culture.",0.24325396825396828,0.36071428571428565,positive
Uniqlo,I never though of it that way... its pretty interesting. Although for some of the items I feel they have gotten worse over the years rather than better (legging pants for instance). They're slightly thinner fabric or not as soft as they were before. I do hope that Uniqlo remains in the US as a staple/basic retailer though. I'm just afraid that the how we view clothing here compared to how its viewed in Japan may be its downfall in 10-15 years.,0.02619047619047619,0.5738095238095238,mixed
Uniqlo,"Interesting.

I went to a Uniqlo for the first time in Strasbourg, France and wasn't impressed. But maybe my SO and I are either shaped weird or have a drastically different clothing aesthetic from FFA and MFA (I lurk, so I don't have that much of an idea of what's ""in"" here other than hearing Uniqlo often.)

- wireless bras of all kind. Now I can't wear any other bras!
-work pants. Super stretchy and fashionable.

Secondly, big boobs and cleavage are out, and that is their bread and butter. Nobody wants push up bras anymore and that aesthetic is seen as tacky.

While I was there (just 2 years), I saw a MASSIVE decline in the quality of materials used.

I’m college-aged, so honestly I love PINK and their materials. Their sweats, hoodies and leggings are amazing. Cute, colorful bras and huge emphasis on bralettes is definitely my kind of style.

They don’t carry a lot in larger sizes - for a reason! I was actually told once that “we don’t want them representing us” (them being bigger women)

Not every bra is available in every size. That’s for a reason, though - some silhouettes aren’t designed for the 40DDD woman, or the 30A. 

VS, I was always less than enthused with. I have a few beautiful lingerie pieces, and I love their pajamas, but I always found it insanely overpriced for what you got.

VSX (sport) is okay, some sports bras are better than others. I have a great pair of VSX leggings that I’ve had for 2 years now.

Even Dream Angels took a massive nosedive in materials - and that was like top-of-the-line stuff.

DO. NOT. BUY. ANY. OF. THEIR. LACE. (unless you want holes within 2 washes.

They discontinue every product you fall in love with - it’s gone in 6 months and never coming back!

We’re *always* 3 months behind whatever is in style.

THE CREDIT CARD IS A RIPOFF.

Avoid the “spend $75 and get a free gift!” - it will fall apart within months (unless it’s the sherpa blanket - that shit might be worth it)

PSA - if the back of your bra doesn’t lie on your back parallel to the floor, it’s too small. if your cups gap, adjust your straps (if that doesn’t work, go smaller in the cup or just flat out try a different silhouette.)

I am not interested in JCrew’s attempts at sequined t-shirts or tulle sweatshirts. But I do shop at Madewell for casual clothes. Why not embrace that differentiation? JCrew could be the destination for office-appropriate clothing and very plain casual basics that appeal to a conservative dresser (which they need to make high quality - “tissue tees” my ass). No more rhinestones, ruffles, and all the other ugly stuff that ends up on the clearance rack.

The company started this new ""mercantile"" brand that is heavily being pushed into the factory stores, while retail carries some mercantile pieces. The new mercantile clothes are made with lower quality, which is a big bummer because a lot of our year-round items got switched over to mercantile branding and it just isn't the same. Customers have also been complaining that they aren't into our new items/designs and also notice the change in quality.

Anyway, that's just what I witnessed from my factory store. I heard from my coworkers that J.Crew is now available at Nordstrom (idk how new or old this info is) and it'll be on amazon as well which is very surprising.

In addition to adopting a lot of the styles you'd see in Madewell, corporate is also trying to push this idea of the ""New Crew"" in an attempt to seem more inclusive when in reality they know that they've lost the customers that came to them for quality garments and are hoping that by casting a wider net, they can grab some more people. I've seen who works at corporate and believe me, that place looks like a straight up sorority with no concern for any real inclusion or diversity.

As another associate in the thread mentioned, they are also trying to push the new ""Mercantile"" line which started because you can't legally have a ""Factory"" store in a standard mall so they started opening ""Mercantile"" stores in malls so they could sell factory merchandise in lower income areas that wouldn't buy from a regular J.Crew. Along with the rebranding of ""Factory"" items as ""Mercantile"", they are starting to bring these items into regular J.Crew stores, but make no mistake these garments are undoubtably cheaper quality.

TLDR J.Crew is drowning, but they know that they can't sell on quality anymore so they're cutting corners on the garments and trying to target a new market in a last-ditch attempt to stay afloat.",0.08852813852813853,0.27940392940392933,neutral

I love good dark green/olive outerwear and the dolman sleeve of this gave it a really fashion-forward slouchy vibe. I’m 5’11” size 4/6 US and got an XL since that gave off the best oversized slouchy effect, and also because the sleeve length fit me the best. I think many others did the same because there were more XS and S out over any other size for this particular jacket and color.

I also tried on the beige trench in an XL since they only had two XLs left on the floor by the time I got there- I really like the sturdiness of the material and construction as well as the plaid, so might end up getting this too if they have it in a smaller size like M or L and it ends up being discounted. Not sure if it actually will be since it seems to be very popular but I don’t want it enough to the point that I’ll pay full price for it now so we’ll see. I also might pick up the shorts on sale too in Olive, it looks cute but not really what I usually wear.

Other than those three items I wasn’t too interested in the rest- they looked cute online but seemed a little lackluster in person.

Gap,The Intention-Execution Gap,0.0,0.0,neutral
Gap,"Why do outfits look “good”? Why do outfits look “bad”? Why do ponte pants annoy me so much?

I was thinking the other day about how ponte pants are a half-assed bridge between leggings and trousers that I dislike, and I think it’s because I imagine people wearing ponte pants are thinking, “I want to be comfortable, but I also want to look professional, like I’m wearing trousers.” However, they really don’t look like someone wearing trousers, they look like someone wearing ponte pants. Ponte pants are tight and clingy, often show bumps, panty lines, and the outlines of tucked-in clothing, and just generally don’t resemble standard, quality, lined trousers in any way (of course cheap unlined trousers are another story). The intention is there, but the execution falls flat. Some ponte pants even have this faux vertical “seam line” intended to make them look more professional, which I find to be a more extreme attempt and thus a more extreme failure of execution.

I have similar feelings about leggings printed to look like jeans. And you may have similar feelings about tuxedo T-shirts, which you wouldn’t wear to any place that requires an actual tuxedo. However, the difference between tuxedo T-shirts and ponte pants is that tuxedo T-shirts are obviously a joke. Intention and execution match up perfectly.


# Example 1: Baby

Ignoring the fact that babies don’t dress themselves, when you see a baby in a cute little polka-dotted onesie [like this](https://i.imgur.com/GjdyOFz.jpg), the intention is to convey, “I’m a baby!”

Suppose you see an adult in the same outfit, no pants and all, maybe with a pacifier or one of those bonnets. Then the intention would also be to convey, “I’m a baby!” except the adult is obviously not a baby. I know we’re big on “you do you” and “don’t yuck someone else’s yum” here, but I would be surprised and unsettled/displeased to see any adult wearing this casually on the street. I’m sure most people would be.

# Example 2: Outdated Fashion
Suppose you see someone wearing [this outfit](https://i.imgur.com/h2hM3rZ.jpg), and suppose it’s 2016. This woman’s intention is to convey, “I’m fashion-forward and trendy!” And she’d be correct.

Now suppose it’s 2023. What would you assume this woman wants to say with her clothes? Probably still “I’m fashion-forward and trendy!” No one was born wearing skinny jeans and a thin waterfall cardigan, and it’s not like these clothes are the most comfortable items of clothing in the world, so it’s a fair assumption. However, trends have moved on. Execution falls flat. If I saw her, I would probably wonder why she hadn’t caught up yet. Is she aware of the passage of time?

You could argue, oh, come on, maybe she just likes the clothing. Sure, but she can’t go up to everybody on the street and tell them that she knows her fit is outdated but she’s still wearing it because she likes it. Maybe she doesn’t care at all what people think of her? That’s fine too. It’s fine to not care.

On the other hand, if this woman were wearing extremely trendy clothes from the 80s in 2023, I would be pretty sure that she knew those clothes weren’t modern, and would probably be impressed by her dedication to vintage style.

Also, if this woman were wearing her aggressively 2016 fit to 2023 New York Fashion Week, I would assume she’d intended to wear it ironically, and would find that pretty funny. So, context matters also. 

# Thoughts
Honestly, most of the time when I see anybody wearing anything outside of the most basic of items, such as a pretty dress or a pair of heels, I assume their intention is to look fashionable. Then, if I don’t like that outfit, I’ll think that their execution fell flat (of course this is up to opinion, and I’m very picky). This is why so many people are averse to dressing up at all, or gravitate towards clothes which are hard to wear “incorrectly,” such as a linen sack dress or leggings; they want to spare themselves the embarrassment of the intention-execution gap. But the only way to end up wearing nicely-executed outfits is to wear a lot of badly-executed outfits first. I’lll admire someone who tried and didn’t stick the landing far more than someone who never bothered to try. 

(But wait a minute, didn’t I just say I hated ponte pants? Isn’t wearing ponte pants a form of trying? They’re a step above leggings, after all, right? Well, really, I consider ponte pants to be a half-step above leggings. Still, a sweater and ponte pants at work is better than a sweater and leggings at work, I’ll give you that.)

# What's my point?

Commit yourself fully to looking the way you want to. This extends to wearing items of clothing that commit themselves fully to looking the way they want – hence, no wishy-washy ponte pants. Buy real fabrics. Don’t wear those shoes that look like loafers but with sneaker bottoms. Go thrifting (or go secondhand shopping online) to find things you truly like outside of what’s current. Wear old jewelry. I guess this is all linked to developing a personal style. Just commit! Soon you will find yourself surrounded by beautiful things.",0.1725745111629943,0.5111532662094458,positive
Gap,"I think in most examples, you're describing items that simply don't meet a standard of dress for a certain scenario:

\- Business attire is tailored fashion.  Ponte pants aren't tailored fashion.

\-Baby clothes are for babies.  An adult is not a baby.

\-Up-to-date fashion is... up to date.  Seven years old is not up to date.

That said, you seem to be making assumptions about these peoples' intentions that aren't simply don't match my experience:

\- A lady in the ponte pants isn't trying to be a pristine example of business attire, she's trying to be as comfortable and budget-friendly as her office dress code allows.   When you consider that as her goal, then ponte pants are wonderful execution.

\- Likewise, if I saw a full grown woman in a polka dot onesie I'd probably assume... she's a gymnast?

\- And the ""I'm fashion-forward and trendy!"" picture you shared is the uniform of the Millenial mom with two jobs and three kids who does not have a single fuck to spare on keeping up with fashions.  If I saw that woman I'd assume that she was dressing in the clothes she learned to love and probably *prefers* that they're not the same clothes the younger kids are wearing.

If you really wanted examples of an intention-execution gap, I'd say maybe a lady is trying to look like a smart business professional so she went out and bought a tailored suit from a reputable source and even took the sales' assistant's advice to have the suit tailored... but she doesn't know how to care for it, and so after a few wears her suit is a bit out of shape.  In cases like that you'd hope that someone who was more knowledgeable would be able to give her some pointers.",0.22857142857142856,0.4366459627329192,positive
Gap,"My intention with clothes is not to look fashionable. I do not give a fuck if I'm following current trends. My intent with clothes varies a great deal. Possibilities include:
- I think this looks good on me
-It's comfy and I can't be arsed
-I'm trying to communicate something specific to someone else (AKA business and formal clothes and fitting in)
-I need to be socially acceptable.

I like clothes. I would not be hanging out in this subreddit if I didn't. It's just that liking clothes and liking fashion trends are entirely different. What I think looks good on me has nothing to do with fashion trends. I do not give a fuck if I look like I came from 2016. Old clothes are not a failed attempt at anything. They're me liking how I look in them and not giving a fuck if they don't match current fashion trends.

I am not embarrassed by any kind of intent-execution gap. I just do not care that much about what other people think of my clothing choices. You're making judgements on factors that I don't even feel are relevant. I am not unhappy with my wardrobe. I am not anxious about it. I'm confident in my leggings.

Gap,"Since you posted this dribble here, I’m assuming you are asking for an opinion.  First and foremost, your intention-execution gap hypothesis is extremely subjective. What are you measuring these people against? High fashion? Street style? Your own arbitrary taste? 


Im not even addressing your baby example because it makes no damn sense. 


To your ponte point: When I wear ponte pants my intention is to…wear ponte pants. Therefore, I have succeeded in my intention/execution mission. Tailored trousers are completely different and I think most people are aware of that. I like ponte fabric because it dresses down an outfit that otherwise may be too formal for an occasion. 


Finally, to your conclusion in which you demand people commit to their fashion choices: What in the judgmental crap is this? Telling people their fear of committing is causing their outfits to fall short of your expectations?? Then you go on to mention an athletic sole on business professional shoe — that’s a very real thing in corporate offices — do you happen to work in one?

Gap,"I think I know what you meant by this comment. The idea that everyone who cares about their style is trying to look trendy is a person's failure to conceptualize beyond their personal experience and motivations.

We all judge from our own POV. When I'm looking at someone who's dressed in a trendy way, I don't automatically think 'oh, their execution is on point'. I think about whether they look comfortable in their get up (or whether they look like they just bought a bunch of trendy items to a checklist and their clothing is now wearing them), whether I get a sense of a personal style and personality, whether their outfit works for their body (skin tone, shape, etc.), and so on. I might judge a person's execution excellent on these markers completely irrespective on whether they're dressed in a trendy way.

My advice is to find brands that work for you and shop there. Zara, Mango always have some form fitting and tailored clothes. I've noticed that many American brands make plain ugly, boxy, gender neutral clothes whereas European brands are always more feminine. I don't have anything against gender neutral clothes per se, but I think the reason they do it is to make it suitable for more customers so they can sell easier. 

I also recently started upgrading from polyester to silk shirts and have done a lot of thrifting. In addition to second hand stores, I also thrift online on Facebook marketplace and ebay which has been great.

Almost every store has kooky accessories, and stocks statement pieces including some rather bold trends that you just know we'll all be laughing at in five years.  As for color, last time I made the rounds about my nearest-big-town's mall, I saw plenty of pastels, but I also saw a lot of mustard, maroon, navy, teal, emerald green, rust and olive to name them ones that stuck out, along with things like nautical stripes, polka dots, and abstract florals.  

20 years ago most store were stocked wall-to-wall in flare jeans and graphic girl tees with cringe mottos on them, with most of the 'variety' coming from the arrangement of plastic gems on the jeans pockets. Stores did tend to be a bit more individualistic in their selection--for example, you got pink and blue graphic girl tees at Aeropostale, and white and cream graphic girl tees at Buckle, black and grey graphic girl tees at Zumiez, and if you couldn't stand the sight of an overweight retail worker you went to Abercrombie & Fitch.  The whole scene quickly converted me into a self-sewer and thrifting zealot, but of course, thrifting at that time was only just beginning to break free of its ""Only for The Poors"" stigma.  Women even older than myself might tell you of a time when mainstream styles were completely ubiquitous, when having alternative style meant crafting your own garments. 

 If you're 24, you might have come to age during that terrifying phase of fast fashion when every stage of clothing production and retail was so cheap that stores (Yes, I'm talking about H&M) could afford the risk of stocking *everything* in hopes that we'd buy *everything.*  Well, we did buy all that cheap crap for a while and now most of it is either in the trash or lining the racks of thrift stores with congenitally threadbare fabrics, broken serging and dangling buttons.  And mind, that stuff is still in production.  You can find it on Wish.  But in between the various trade wars, labor shortages and skyrocketing rent prices on retail space, competition from online sources, and the death-spiraling economic and environmental prospects of younger consumers... it's hard to be a brick-and-mortar store these days.

Majority of the brands are drop shipped or just hoodie and tee brands. I’m personally an Avant Garde fiend and have built a collection consisting of Saint Laurent, Rick Owens, Comme Des Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto. That said, I style them with pieces from Uniqlo, which have excellent basics IMHO. Aside from that, I have come across so many designers that have had me in awe. Their work was inspiring. Some of these brands include Priya Ahluwalia, Sabyasachi, The Plagiarist.

The problem with the fashion market is the barrier of entry is low. Therefore anyone can dropship from alibaba thinking they’re the next big brand.

The rise in price has definitely reflected the demand in fashion and you now pay a premium for unique designs. Sorry for the rant :)",0.1982142857142857,0.5660714285714286,positive

Most of those mall stores you listed don't even exist anymore. Especially with quarantine, brands/companies are not investing in great in-person retail experiences.

Also, the cost of consumer goods has just...gone up, especially during the pandemic. In the early 2000s, you could get decent jeans from GAP for under $60.

I’m also in my early twenties and the brands that my friends and I like right now are Mango, Zara(only at their semi annual sale), Free People, American Eagle and Aerie, Revice Denim, Rollas, & Other Stories, House of Sunny, Aritzia, Petal & Pup, For Love & Lemons, Sam Edelman, House of CB, Sezane, and yeah, sometimes Shein (they have great little going out tops).",0.2589285714285714,0.4792857142857142,positive
Mango,"Clothing does seem very boring because everything leans toward baggy boxy clothes from the 90s... I feel that if I kept my old clothes from when I was a teenager, they'd fit right into this style (it's a nightmare I don't want to remember though considering I'm short and curvy). 

My advice is to find brands that work for you and shop there. Zara, Mango always have some form fitting and tailored clothes. I've noticed that many American brands make plain ugly, boxy, gender neutral clothes whereas European brands are always more feminine. I don't have anything against gender neutral clothes per se, but I think the reason they do it is to make it suitable for more customers so they can sell easier. 

I also recently started upgrading from polyester to silk shirts and have done a lot of thrifting. In addition to second hand stores, I also thrift online on Facebook marketplace and ebay which has been great.

On colours, I'm under the impression that this season (or the last two) have seen a big comeback of colours. I'm happy with ""boring"" as you say, dusty and pastel colours because they fit me really well, but I've seen plenty of full, bold colours in Zara...

People are tightening their belts, so I get why durability is winning over flimsy trendy designs, since we aren't allowed to enjoy those designs for years like in the past: micro-trends are so fast you'll get people who say ""oh X item is sooo fashionable!"" and then 5 months later ""omg X item is so last year!"".   
Fashion was funnier in the past because we could actually enjoy quality pieces (and by quality I literally just means better fabrics and seams that didn't burst after 2 wears, Zara pieces from 20 years ago seem like a luxury now), mix and match them for years, spruce them up with other trends that were all made to fit well together.

Welcome to reddit 

Also mention the word ""quality"" in your post, watch all the comments be about quality lol. 

Users who've been on this sub for some time will be well familiar with the fact that most people in an advice sub don't know what they're doing--that's why they're here, which is normal and natural for an advice sub--but about women's fashion in particular I do feel there are lots of people who aren't interested in fashion at all and in fact would rather not think or spend time on it as much as humanly possible, they just want to be able to perform for different occasions in life ""I want to look put together/hot/older or younger than I am"" --probably unavoidable on a space for women's fashion advice. 

But you raise an interesting question. Widespread conversation about quality has been happening here on FFA for a couple years now, it didn't start this year or with ""old money"" trends, but certainly picked up after the worst of the pandemic. Im not sure why either, but I do think it's something easy for even beginners to pick up on. They may not know terms like godets or yoke but they do know an unraveled seam on the hem of H&M pants, or pilling on that Quince sweater when they see it, pulling it out of the dryer. If you're not particularly interested in fashion, the design doesn't matter to you as much as durability, and ""quality"" here usually means ""I can machine wash and dry it on the hot and fast settings together with my jeans that have big metal buttons and zippers, and it won't look any different from the day I bought it"" 

When design discussions happen here it's usually in the context of finding dupes of individual higher priced pieces, or ""this Shein dress that isn't Shein"" and not as something a particular brand is good or bad at in general. Except for maybe whenever Uniqlo is mentioned. When it opened a store in the U.S. it was the first time many mainstream fashion consumers there were introduced to clothing made for a different market, and so a lot of folks took issues with the designs. 

But perhaps the lack of conversation on design is because talking about it requires one to have some interest and knowledge in how and why garments are constructed, which is a pretty niche interest. Also I suspect, requires one to think about how clothes fit on bodies, and also about clothes that go beyond being human-bodily-shaped as it were, and since especially in online advice subs where people ask questions *because* they don't like fashion and have insecurities about it, lots of users are loth to do that. 

I do think it's also trending in marketing, as a way for slightly higher priced brands to get consumers to buy their product instead of jumping on the Shein train. Fast fashion is reaching its inevitable event horizon there and so ""quality"" is the only way other brands have to gain appeal, so it's dominating the conversation.",0.13157467532467534,0.5672799422799423,positive

Express and Gap were much better quality than what’s for sale at almost every store now. That changed in the 00s when the cheap knits trend entered the market and fast fashion blew up with Forever 21.

A major change is that people have more clothes than they once did.

Madewell,"Just want to throw in some thoughts. I noticed in the past maybe 2 to 3 years, for almost single posts across different clothing subreddits, I see tons of comments emphasizing the decline of quality and how things were made better years ago.

I posted something in the Madewell subreddit the other day and the purpose of the post was to discuss how the change of corporate leadership destroyed the designs, marketing… etc. 

And it happened again, the post was flooded with comments about the decline of quality with a few comments complaining about how boring the clothes are nowadays.

Don’t get me wrong, I totally agree that across the board in many brands, there’s been a decline of quality and companies should be less greedy and do better. 

But I am feeling in the year of 2025 probably after the prolonged “Old Money” trend, people lost the ability to properly discuss designs and trends without the discussion being completely hijacked by the quality comments. And people seem to only use the word “boring” or lack of colors when it comes to designs instead of actually having a useful observation or conversation.

And things get even worse from there. Usually in the same thread of quality decline, someone would ask what are the alternatives now to the brand? And it really drives me crazy to see people suggesting Old Navy, Quince or today I saw someone suggesting Costco as the substitute to the brand that has lost its shine. I totally agree Madewell is not good anymore hence I made the post, but suggesting Costco’s clothes is on par with Madewell made me doubt people’s sense of fashion.

I mean why would I spend 300$ on something from a place like reformation when I get something of very similar cut and style and the same low quality somewhere like old navy? It’s gotten to that point. I keep returning clothes from places like banana republic and Aritzia because I’m shocked that it feels identical to clothing I’ve bought from Shein, and that’s no joke.

I feel if I said I still like them then I'll probably get downvoted lol. It's sad imo.

It depends on what you're willing to pay for. Seldom are people willing to dish cash for just design, if the quality isn't there. Just an evolution of fashion consumption.",0.11458333333333333,0.6979166666666666,positive
Madewell,"I think it’s a shift from wear-once to wear-multiple-times mentality. Might have to do with the old money trend like you said. Before, we can “afford” to buy multiple $10,$20 shirts with different prints because we know they won’t last long, or we have many of them so each will get worn 5-6 times at most. Interestingly, I came across a stat that a piece of clothing in America gets worn 5-6 times on average.

More durable clothes are designed with a different philosophy. We know that if someone is spending $100 on a shirt, they’ll want to make the most of it. A plain beige shirt is more…versatile than one with memorable designs. And we don’t want to be remembered as an outfit repeater (how ironic). When consumers want to wear a piece of clothing multiple times, the supplier adjusts their products accordingly, hence “boring” designs with a focus on better quality.

There might be something with the survey population too. The consumers of Madewell do not value the same things as the consumers of Anthro. Just like J Crew is not the same as WHBM. 

I agree with the people who say Madewell and Old Navy or Costco are the same tier. Madewell has lost its “high quality” positioning a long time ago. Even their jeans are trash now.",0.10815476190476193,0.41828373015873016,positive
Madewell,"I don’t think that you can really have one without the other. Fit and style are so intertwined, as are fit and quality. An interesting design that is constructed from cheap materials and doesn’t fit right won’t look good. 

I think Madewell is an example of a brand known for its denim that was always kind of basic style-wise but had clothes that were decent quality with a lot of fit options for different body types. Madewell had wide leg pants when most similar mall stores only had skinny and straight leg. That made cuts seem more interesting. Now every brand is selling different cuts of jeans so it’s not interesting. And there are more niche brands with extended sizing and curvy sizing so Madewell doesn’t have that market cornered anymore.

You also have to keep in mind that Madewell is very much a millennial brand. Most of its clientele want different things from fashion, or have evolved style and budget into their 30s. I used to buy jeans at Madewell. Now the quality is bad and i find it a waste of money; I wouldn’t go back even if they made more interesting designs because I know the fit, materials, and construction are not up to my standards. 

I’m in a few b/s/t groups for higher end and slow fashion brands, eg Doen.

I do think it's also trending in marketing, as a way for slightly higher priced brands to get consumers to buy their product instead of jumping on the Shein train. Fast fashion is reaching its inevitable event horizon there and so ""quality"" is the only way other brands have to gain appeal, so it's dominating the conversation.",0.13157467532467534,0.5672799422799423,positive
Madewell,"I personally struggle to talk about design for a company that spouts that it’s ethical, that it’s ‘made well’ implying that the product should last, but somehow every piece of clothing I’ve purchased from them has awkwardly stretched or split at the seams, even with minimal wear. I’ve never had any problems with much cheaper fast fashion clothing, but I’ve also stopped buying fast fashion for the past 10 or so years. 

Madewell is marketed as quality and ethical clothing. Quality and ethical fashion is not aligned with fast fashion, and discussion about the design needs to be consistent with ethical design- design that will last through variation in fashion. This means the clothing needs to be more ‘timeless’ than fast fashion clothing, but also last longer than fast fashion clothing.

I’d rather be wearing a less fashionable pair of jeans from old navy than have my loose fitted Madewell jeans split while out at dinner.

I don’t mind paying over $100 for quality ethically made jeans, but if I’m buying jeans 2x a year because I can only get 26-30 wears out of the jeans, they are no more ethical than $25 old navy jeans that last 4 years wearing 2x a week. 

I personally rarely think their designs are good, but I don’t really care at all because in my experience, shopping at Madewell is a waste of money. 

But to more directly respond to your point- the quality of modern clothing is just horrible. My jeans in the 90s, early 2000s lasted years of abuse. Today’s clothing doesn’t. Brands that claim to make higher quality clothing aren’t making clothing near the quality of inexpensive clothing from 25 years ago. So, people aren’t emphasizing quality over design because they care about quality more, it’s because the quality is so poor that they can’t justify the purchase.",0.09283927454659163,0.4244527829893683,neutral

Express has some amazing sales and I can spend slightly more there than H&M and get much better quality pieces. I rarely buy anything full price while I'm there, but will occasionally splurge on a nice blazer or dress.

If you are looking for inspiration on style, my advise is to look outside of other people's favourite brands. Think about outfits that makes you feel the best and work for your lifestyle. Then go on pinterest and search for keywords based on that and cerate your own moodboard.  PInterest is great for inspiration but the key is not copying brand by brand or piece by piece of what the lady on your pinterest inspiration is weraing, more about the elements of style she is using.  I fidn everytime I feel in a style rut, it's helpful to explore again my own personal style and make tweatks as needed.

Uniqlo is definitely my go-to, especially the Ines de la Fressange for Uniqlo annual drop. I work in academia, so it's perfect for my job haha. Banana Republic, Ann Taylor LOFT, and Target's wannabe Madewell line (A New Day) are staples. Recently, I've discovered Rachel Zoe. I buy most of these from ThredUP or Goodwills.

For activewear, I look for quality brands at resale shops: Lululemon, Athlete, Nike PRO, Under Armour. I'll wear gym gear until it's literally falling apart at the seams (I just lost a favorite pair of Nike sport capris, bought secondhand 15 years ago). I buy most of these pieces from in-person thrift shops so I can check the quality & wear directly.

For shoes, Clarks full stop. They're comfortable, supportive, and never wear out. I discovered the brand twelve years ago, when I bought a pair of heeled loafers for $5 at Goodwill as part of baby's first business casual outfit. I just wore them yesterday to a faculty and staff reception. 

These brands reflect my current age, job, and lifestyle. I definitely went through an early-20s phase where I preferred trendy, playful, statement pieces by Modcloth (the old version), Fabletics, ASOS, etc. I wasn't wearing them every single day, and the trends changed, so the pieces didn't have to be super high-quality and long-lasting.",0.1872397443826015,0.5401566687280973,positive

Madewell,"I'm in my early thirties. I thrift or Thredup most of my clothes, excluding underthings and shoes. I prioritize quality and natural fibers. (Polyester really stinks in the summer and vinegar breaks down the lighter weights after too many focused washes).

Uniqlo is definitely my go-to, especially the Ines de la Fressange for Uniqlo annual drop. I work in academia, so it's perfect for my job haha. Banana Republic, Ann Taylor LOFT, and Target's wannabe Madewell line (A New Day) are staples. Recently, I've discovered Rachel Zoe. I buy most of these from ThredUP or Goodwills.

For activewear, I look for quality brands at resale shops: Lululemon, Athlete, Nike PRO, Under Armour. I'll wear gym gear until it's literally falling apart at the seams (I just lost a favorite pair of Nike sport capris, bought secondhand 15 years ago). I buy most of these pieces from in-person thrift shops so I can check the quality & wear directly.

For shoes, Clarks full stop. They're comfortable, supportive, and never wear out. I discovered the brand twelve years ago, when I bought a pair of heeled loafers for $5 at Goodwill as part of baby's first business casual outfit. I just wore them yesterday to a faculty and staff reception. 

These brands reflect my current age, job, and lifestyle. I definitely went through an early-20s phase where I preferred trendy, playful, statement pieces by Modcloth (the old version), Fabletics, ASOS, etc. I wasn't wearing them every single day, and the trends changed, so the pieces didn't have to be super high-quality and long-lasting.",0.1872397443826015,0.5401566687280973,positive

Uniqlo,"I also always cold wash (30 degrees, right?) and line dry, I think none of them ever saw the inside of a dryer. Keep in mind materials matter IMO (denim ones are fine) and maybe the type of color also matter - darker fade faster (mine are darker, apart from the denim one). Fit would matter, if they were  being stretched very much and stressed by my body that would make it less long lasting, but it´s not case, I could downsize even (and in the case of the ponte leggings I wish I had because they were so huge!). 

I do not think, particularly in the case of the printed ones which are the worst off,  that it´s my  carelessness with washing - it´s a dark print which maybe makes it less long lasting, but the printing on  a material so stretchy, if you took a look at the reverse, the reverse was white and pattern hardly visible, meaning the print did not go very deep. Also if with a your fingers you give a small but strong pull to the fabric outside, you see the fabric turn white meaning the print was very very superficial and explains why it is fading so fast. I should have thought of this before buying!

The other two solid color non-denim leggings, the color is much deeper, uniformly dyed - but I have also worn them and washed them more often and I think I am starting to see issues with the materials, hint of pilling starting, a pulled out thread or two on the ponte ones where my boot top hits.  Maybe I am ridiculously picky with tiny material issues (and they are tiny) but just leaving a word of warning. I noticed some brands also make these type of leggings, I will be looking around, rather than buying more uniqlo ones.

I’ve bought a pair of wool trousers, a silk skirt, a cotton top and a boiled wool jacket from them, all are great quality. The silk skirt is lined and a lovely, thick silk, the wool jacket has heft. Love it, have my eye on a few more items.

* [Maje](https://eu.maje.com/en/homepage/) - not exactly a new brand, but new to me. I bought my first item (a Chanel-esque cardigan) last summer and loved it some much I’ve gone back to get a tweed dress and a wool blazer. Good quality on all
items.

* [Arket](https://www.arket.com) - the fancier cousin of H&M/& Other Stories. Lots of natural materials - I have an alpaca/wool sweater and a wool skirt, both feel nice and high quality (and not that expensive, comparatively! Definitely cheaper than Sezane, for example). Also great for decent basics - I have a few t-shirts/tank tops and they’ve held up great so far.

*[Ba&sh](https://ba-sh.com/fr/en) - hits that same spot of French dresses that Sezane used to. I have three, love them all - and two were bought during a sale, for a similar price Zara dresses go for.

*[Loulou Studio](https://louloustudio.fr/en/) - discovered this brand on the Outnet. Great 100% cashmere items. I have two sweaters and a dress, and am lazy enough to just chuck them in the washing machine on the gentle cycle, they’ve held up well.",0.18832944832944828,0.4837373737373737,positive

H&M basics (their Divided house brand) also sells like $5 shirts in various neck lines, so I have a few of those, though I don't prefer them because they have shorter sleeves (or cap sleeves) that bunch more at the armpit.

I’m just a regular ole consumer but I’ve known this for years, and am glad that my assumptions are correct. 

People like to shit on Asian online marketplaces for making “rip offs” of fast fashion items, but are they really rip offs of the item if it’s being made there anyways?? You’re just buying the item directly from the Chinese manufacturer instead of Topshop, H&M, Zara, etc.

This may be a controversial opinion here but guess what, a lot of luxury brands have their items assembled or sourced from China as well.

Until just a few years ago, I did all my garment production in NYC and Los Angeles but all of the fabric originated in Chinese, Korean and Indian mills.  There was no way to lock down all points in the supply chain to ensure ethical, green standards.  On inspection of a Los Angeles cut & sew operation, I discovered that all of the non managerial workers were undocumented immigrants, and that they relied on a sophisticated system of document forgers that rotated social security numbers every 6 months, giving the appearance of high turnover, but ensuring that when the Feds came back with errors on their SSNs, they were already “gone”.

New York, on the other hand was 100% clean, but out of reach for most designers, especially at high quantities.

Luxury brands know about replicas. Whether they know about which exact factory the products come from, I don’t know. If anything, they know about sellers who get caught or reported.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

-----------------


**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

Uniqlo,"I worked in marketing for fast fashion ecommerce brands over the past few years. I’ve since switched industries but figured that behind the scenes knowledge could be interesting for some. A bit of a disclaimer: please note that my experiences are just that. My experiences. So they may not necessarily apply to _every_ brand out there.

------------



**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn’t to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it’s due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they’re often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it’s a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it’s supposed to fit and they aren’t usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn’t necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer’s follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the “Paid Partnership” feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn’t. But it’s actually in both the brand and the influencer’s interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it’s not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it’s not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn’t good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It’s effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

-----------------


**Everyone Copies Everyone… and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion’s runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you’ll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand’s garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul’s largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it’s not because they care about the environment. It’s because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it’s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That’s not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand’s DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It’s worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China’s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

 The biggest difference is the leather is microscopically different, which wouldn’t be the case if it was coming from the same factory. [Here’s another video.](https://youtu.be/BiGapz44Odg) 


There are some replica products, most commonly clothing, that are usually sold unbranded and are from the official factory. These are grey market. Factories work and produce additional items after they’re supposed to stop. These range from Zara to Madewell, Everlane, to Zimmerman. This also isn’t for every single product they sell, but certain ones. 


Luxury brands know about replicas. Whether they know about which exact factory the products come from, I don’t know. If anything, they know about sellers who get caught or reported. They aren’t ok with that and will take legal action. I also doubt they’re okay with dupes either.

I have been a long time lurker and have gotten many useful tips on fashion amongst other things here, so I thought it'd be nice to contribute to the community. Below is a list of some minimalist brands that I have personally shopped and my honest opinion about them, which may be quite different from what you read online. 

My personal style: I like clothes that are comfortable, made of natural materials and minimalist with a twist. I know many minimalists stick with true basics (t shirt + jeans) but I like to have a bit of design feature that stands out without being too over the top (not a huge fan of excessive lace, frills, leopard prints, neon colors or overly tight clothing). My favorite go-tos are shirts/blouses, skinny jeans/wide leg pants, blazers, trench coats and flats/loafers on most days. Quality is important to me as I like to keep my clothes for quite some time.

**Review**:

[**COS**](https://www.cosstores.com/en_usd/index.html)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 3/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 4/5**

Their fabrics are of very good quality and their styles are minimalist but not boring. The price point is very reasonable considering the quality. I would wear 100% COS if only their stuff fits me a bit better. Unfortunately I find their styles to be unflattering on hourglass body shapes and I tend to look very bloated in styles that don't come in at the waist. That being said, I think their clothes would look amazing on someone who is less curvy.

&#x200B;

[**APC**](https://www.apc-us.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 3/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

Quality is great but can get a bit pricey. Personally I prefer a monochrome/simple neutral look and find their prints to be too busy. I also find their color palette to suit people with cool skin tone better. For these reasons it is not a great fit for me but may suit someone who prefer colorful prints and cool tone clothes. 

&#x200B;

[**Uniqlo**](http://uniqlo.com)

Quality: 3/5

Style: 3/5

Fit: 3/5

Price: 5/5

**Overall: 3.5/5**

Even though Uniqlo is recommended a lot on reddit, personally I have not had good luck with their items. I find their jeans and bras to lose shape quickly. Fabric on shirts is thin/flimsy and lost shape after one wash. Cashmere sweaters are quite thin and they feel more like merino wool than cashmere. Their pants are also quite short and would probably look a bit off on someone who is not petite. As a result, even though I like the price point I don't buy much from them.

I have also not had good luck with their heat tech line which is extremely popular. For me, they perform exactly as advertised, which is turning moisture from your body to heat. But I actually find this feature to be very uncomfortable because when do our bodies have lots of moisture? It is when we are sweating. So basically when I'm sitting idle and being really cold, it doesn't really do much, and when I'm out and about and sweating due to the movements, it turns those sweat into heat which causes me to sweat even more which turns into even more heat. Since it is worn as an under garment, it's not easy to take it off when you are out and about. And the end result is the feeling of baking in a pool of sweat, which I find quite unpleasant.

&#x200B;

[**Everlane**](https://www.everlane.com)

Quality: 3.5/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

I really love the ethics of Everlane and what it stands for but I wasn't impressed with its quality. I bought many t-shirts from them and had to return pretty much everything because they felt flimsy. The fabric was thin and the cotton was scratchy even though they were advertised as Pima Cotton. Put a t-shirt from COS and Everlane side by side and the difference in quality is night and day. Someone I knew bought a canvas backpack from them and the zipper broke after a month. The style and fit of their items are okay, but can look boxy on someone with curves. As much as I like their ""radical transparency"", I cannot support a brand that doesn't deliver on quality.

&#x200B;

[**Acne Studios**](https://www.acnestudios.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 2.5/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

The items from Acne Studios are great quality but their prints and bright colors are a bit much for me. It is just not a look I can pull off on a day-to-day basis. The price point is also a bit high for me personally so it's not a brand I shop frequently. 

&#x200B;

[**Madewell**](https://www.madewell.com)

Quality: 3/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

A beloved brand by many but I'll have to be honest, I wasn't impressed with their quality at all. The cotton feels dry and scratchy and they use a lot of polyester. Honestly I feel like their quality is on par with fast fashion although the prices of the items are much higher. 

&#x200B;

[**Reformation**](https://www.thereformation.com)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 3.9/5**

Some of Reformation's dresses are really pretty and I also appreciate that they use natural and sustainable fabrics. That said, I think I'm getting a little too old to wear their body hugging styles and also their sizes tend to run very small. 

&#x200B;

**Now moving on to some lesser known brands:**

[**Mijeong Park**](https://mijeongpark.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 4.1/5**

This is a lesser known brand that I found by a google search on minimalist brands. I immediately fell in love with their neutral colors and minimalist aesthetics. I like that they use quality and natural fabrics and the items I bought have held up very well after repeat wear. Their price point is higher than fast fashion but still very reasonable considering that it is from an independent designer and the quality of their items. My favorite items from them are fall sweaters and oversized wool coats. 

&#x200B;

[**SKYE**](https://shop-skye.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 4.1/5**

If you like clothing that are feminine and minimalist with a twist, then I highly recommend SKYE. I absolutely love their minimal and elegant aesthetics. They also use quality and natural fabrics which are not only comfortable, but last through repeat wear. Most of their designs have belts or something that cinches in the waist so a curvier person like myself doesn't have to look bloated. At this point, half of my closet is from SKYE and I love that they offer free shipping and free returns. 

&#x200B;

[**Waltz Studio**](https://waltzstudio.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 3/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

Waltz uses quality fabrics and their items are made in California. As much as I enjoy the quality of their times, I do find their styles a bit challenging to wear either because of the cut or the color. Their price point is also a bit high but they do have sales occasionally. 

&#x200B;

[**Vetta**](https://www.vettacapsule.com)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

If you love capsule wardrobe comprised of basics, you should check out Vetta. Every season they come out with a few capsules consisting of 5 pieces that work together to form about 30 looks. I think the concept is genius. It makes getting dressed easy if you would just like to look presentable and don't care much for trends. For me personally their clothes can be a little on the shorter and boxier side (kinda like uniqlo) but they may look amazing on someone else. 

&#x200B;

[**AYR**](https://www.ayr.com/)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 3.9/5**

If you love minimal shirts and jeans, then AYR is for you. I like their use of natural, quality fabrics. They are best known for their denim although I've had good luck with their shirts and dresses as well. Prices are higher than fast fashion but still reasonable considering the quality of the items.

I'm pretty petite (5'1"", which is about average height for an Asian woman) and Uniqlo is the only brand where I have to think very little about sizing because everything they make in an S size is pretty much guaranteed to fit me, and most of their trousers and jeans are at a good length for me without needing to shorten whereas for most other brands, I can forget about buying their jeans. Some of their shirts have a looser / baggier fit than I would like, but I'm usually very satisfied with the quality of fabric and make. I've only ever had one item from them tear, and that was after literally 4 years of constant use and putting it through harsh washing routine (back when I lived in the UK and didn't know that dryers literally destroy your clothes).

Uniqlo,"I'll be the third to add my opinion of Uniqlo. I've used the same heattech tops and leggings for about three years for hiking, backpacking, and travel in 30-50 degree weather and they're incredibly warm.

For comparison, I own Patagonia baselayers and North Face layers and neither is as warm which made the price point favorable to Uniqlo instead of the pricier outdoor competitors. The uniqlo pieces were also able to go longer without being washed because they didn't pick up smells easily. Since my old job was being an outdoor guide, that was a huge perk. I also did try to wear them while driving, sleeping, or sitting around, and I just got way too hot.

Moving on to their other items. I am selective about tops at Uniqlo. I don't like everything they offer because I agree that t-shirts and sweaters feel short-term/low quality. Currently I have a couple button ups that I really like because they look and feel really nice. I also own their pants and 100% concede that they're too short.

That being said, I think their clothes would look amazing on someone who is less curvy.

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 3/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

Quality is great but can get a bit pricey. Personally I prefer a monochrome/simple neutral look and find their prints to be too busy. I also find their color palette to suit people with cool skin tone better. For these reasons it is not a great fit for me but may suit someone who prefer colorful prints and cool tone clothes.

[**Uniqlo**](http://uniqlo.com)

Quality: 3/5

Style: 3/5

Fit: 3/5

Price: 5/5

**Overall: 3.5/5**

Even though Uniqlo is recommended a lot on reddit, personally I have not had good luck with their items. I find their jeans and bras to lose shape quickly. Fabric on shirts is thin/flimsy and lost shape after one wash. Cashmere sweaters are quite thin and they feel more like merino wool than cashmere. Their pants are also quite short and would probably look a bit off on someone who is not petite. As a result, even though I like the price point I don't buy much from them.

I have also not had good luck with their heat tech line which is extremely popular. For me, they perform exactly as advertised, which is turning moisture from your body to heat. But I actually find this feature to be very uncomfortable because when do our bodies have lots of moisture? It is when we are sweating. So basically when I'm sitting idle and being really cold, it doesn't really do much, and when I'm out and about and sweating due to the movements, it turns those sweat into heat which causes me to sweat even more which turns into even more heat. Since it is worn as an under garment, it's not easy to take it off when you are out and about. And the end result is the feeling of baking in a pool of sweat, which I find quite unpleasant.

[**Everlane**](https://www.everlane.com)

Quality: 3.5/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

I really love the ethics of Everlane and what it stands for but I wasn't impressed with its quality. I bought many t-shirts from them and had to return pretty much everything because they felt flimsy. The fabric was thin and the cotton was scratchy even though they were advertised as Pima Cotton. Put a t-shirt from COS and Everlane side by side and the difference in quality is night and day. Someone I knew bought a canvas backpack from them and the zipper broke after a month. The style and fit of their items are okay, but can look boxy on someone with curves. As much as I like their ""radical transparency"", I cannot support a brand that doesn't deliver on quality.

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 3.5/5

Price: 2.5/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

The items from Acne Studios are great quality but their prints and bright colors are a bit much for me. It is just not a look I can pull off on a day-to-day basis. The price point is also a bit high for me personally so it's not a brand I shop frequently.

[**Madewell**](https://www.madewell.com)

Quality: 3/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

A beloved brand by many but I'll have to be honest, I wasn't impressed with their quality at all. The cotton feels dry and scratchy and they use a lot of polyester. Honestly I feel like their quality is on par with fast fashion although the prices of the items are much higher.

Some of Reformation's dresses are really pretty and I also appreciate that they use natural and sustainable fabrics. That said, I think I'm getting a little too old to wear their body hugging styles and also their sizes tend to run very small.

**Now moving on to some lesser known brands:**

[**Mijeong Park**](https://mijeongpark.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 4.1/5**

This is a lesser known brand that I found by a google search on minimalist brands. I immediately fell in love with their neutral colors and minimalist aesthetics. I like that they use quality and natural fabrics and the items I bought have held up very well after repeat wear. Their price point is higher than fast fashion but still very reasonable considering that it is from an independent designer and the quality of their items. My favorite items from them are fall sweaters and oversized wool coats. 

&#x200B;

[**SKYE**](https://shop-skye.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 4.1/5**

If you like clothing that are feminine and minimalist with a twist, then I highly recommend SKYE. I absolutely love their minimal and elegant aesthetics. They also use quality and natural fabrics which are not only comfortable, but last through repeat wear. Most of their designs have belts or something that cinches in the waist so a curvier person like myself doesn't have to look bloated. At this point, half of my closet is from SKYE and I love that they offer free shipping and free returns. 

&#x200B;

[**Waltz Studio**](https://waltzstudio.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 3/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

Waltz uses quality fabrics and their items are made in California. As much as I enjoy the quality of their times, I do find their styles a bit challenging to wear either because of the cut or the color. Their price point is also a bit high but they do have sales occasionally. 

&#x200B;

[**Vetta**](https://www.vettacapsule.com)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

If you love capsule wardrobe comprised of basics, you should check out Vetta. Every season they come out with a few capsules consisting of 5 pieces that work together to form about 30 looks. I think the concept is genius. It makes getting dressed easy if you would just like to look presentable and don't care much for trends. For me personally their clothes can be a little on the shorter and boxier side (kinda like uniqlo) but they may look amazing on someone else. 

&#x200B;

[**AYR**](https://www.ayr.com/)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 3.9/5**

If you love minimal shirts and jeans, then AYR is for you. I like their use of natural, quality fabrics. They are best known for their denim although I've had good luck with their shirts and dresses as well. Prices are higher than fast fashion but still reasonable considering the quality of the items.

Zara,"It really depends what you get from them tbh. I love them in the winter because their heavier knit sweaters and their coats are my favorites. I own several chunky knits from them that hold up well and don’t snag. I own a fur jacket that also is still perfected, and my favorite coat of all time is lined all the way through with fur and fits great. 

Their shoes are also wonderful. My favorite pair of Chelsea boots is from there and I’ve had them for a good 3/4 years. Still in great condition aside from it being super dirty. I also have their super chunky platform sneakers from this past season and they’re comfy and still in good condition, and I’ve worn them on long walks in NY. I have worse luck with their taller boots though, and they can be uncomfortable or just not fit certain calves. My calves aren’t even that big and they were not right. 

I haven’t gotten jeans from them in a while but the pants I’ve gotten are still great but can be annoying to wash. Some styles are also not friendly to thicker thighs, like mine. 

I love their dresses and have a plaid maxi I’ve had for about 2 years that’s still great. On the contrary, I have an oddly shaped boxy dress that is horrible. Zara sometimes has issues with silhouettes, and this dress is weird in that when you lift up your arms, it lifts up the whole dress and you see everything. It would work better as a tunic but still is largely unflattering. I also have several oversized hoodies which do fare much better but can still lay weirdly on the body. Some of their boxier cuts are bad, and I recommend if you’re like me and enjoy a boxy oversized fit, head over to somewhere like Uniqlo for that stuff. 

Their tees are a hit or miss. The fabric kinda sucks especially for their boxier tees with the cute prints, but they make for cute layering pieces. 

Their bags are also great. I have a few that have held up over the years with no issue. Can’t speak on their accessories as much sadly, but they have some lovely scarves. 

Zara’s more expensive pieces hold up well. Otherwise, it’s trendy garbage but it’s still a good way to experiment with styles and trends you’re not completely sold on. Their prices have changed a bit over the years sadly and it seems expensive for no reason, so I recommend going during the winter for coats and during the spring for dresses and shoes.

If you're looking for basics, I'd try and find other brands tho. For example, Kotn has some reasonable priced items that look sturdy (and they're Sustainable).

going to zara, both the online site and physically and browsing is something I do lots, to keep  track of what new fashions are out, to try things, to see if I find something oddly quirky or perfect basic. At least here Zara is not worth hanging out for sales if you see somehting you like, things do sell out fast. 

quality varies very much, trafaluc is worse (and cut smaller), zara woman usually good, I have had some very good pieces from there. their wool coats and leather shoes are good value (here!). Their cashmere is dense and resistant to machine washing ( do not do as I do, I take no responsability. it needs to be dry flat though) also. t-shirts also. I have had 20 euros blazers of 40 euros coats on sale which I have worn far more and look good for ages far more than more expensive stuff which should be better but it did not.  the children's leather shoes and boots are a GREAT hack, if their size fits you. Midi skirts, they are fantastic at those, every season. sometimes with pockets! I got a 50 euro brocade skirt from theirs once whoch I would compare favorably to a max mara one I also had.

things from theirs I do not like - the hangbags even when leather, the scarves are always (except maybe cashmere) nasty materials, the perfumes I also disliked (but when they had makeup it was awesome for the price! and the candles are very good). sometimes the blazers got skimpy sized pockets and they never have inside pockets but oh well.

I always gets things from zara every season, every sale season and off it. If I need something I always check them. I rarely buy, maybe because I check them every week. Also you know, I think they are the retailer which has more ITEMS in every season, every week they have hundreds of new items, which is a crazy volume. They can be reallyexperimental with silhouettes (and the more experimental stuff usually does not sell out and hangs around months and months). at least, some of their stuff arrives, sells, and is out of stock on 2/3 weeks - they are very good at responding and putting more when something is really popular, but things which sell out but slightly less when it is out it is out-

And Zara is IMo unbeatable at making shopping easier, the app scanner (They were the first), the online stock is up to date, the returns are processed in any store and are so fast at being returned, the information all laid out. Comparing it to HM it's worlds apart.

also, check massimo dutti - it's more upmarket, better materials and cuts, more conservative, but costs about twice what zara does. But Massimo Dutti is great for acessories, particularly handbags, and work tops and scarves.",0.25910327767470626,0.5772506405159465,positive

Growing up, probably 80% of my wardrobe was Zara because at the time, there were only 3 affordable shops that sold ok clothes that i knew of in my country.

I have two knits, one is an acrylic blend is really showing signs of wear and a tooooon of pilling after 2 years. The other is 5+ years and still looks good except I think it's starting to lose its shape.

Zara,"Where do you live? I live in the UK and my favourite brands are:

Whistles for coats and bags (just amazing quality and timeless style)

Jigsaw for trousers

COS or &Other stories for knitwear

Russel and Bromley or Office for shoes

The closest in style to Zara I would say is Whistles or & other stories but they’re a bit more expensive. The quality reflects that though.

Topshop is similar to Zara because it’s fast fashion. Topshop jeans are brilliant quality and their tops generally last well but some do look a bit cheap...

I think Zara manage to draw so many people because they do quit fashion-y looks really quickly after the runway shows but they compromise on quality to get the pieces out there.",0.21114718614718614,0.544047619047619,positive
Zara,"I think it depends how you shop. Those places become more affordable in the sale obviously so I usually make a wish list and wait until the prices drop. Whistles regularly do 30% off the entire site.

Topshop is cheaper than Zara.

If you buy a Zara top for £30 but it lasts 5 wears it works out far more expensive than a £60 top from whistles which lasts for years. You do have to pay for quality in my opinion. 

The OP asked for similar look not similar prices. I agree that they are all more expensive on first pass but if you buy from eBay or depop or wait for the sales these pieces last for literally years. For example I have a wool sale coat from whistles from five years ago which was reduced to £105. It still looks new. Or this year I bought a camel wool coat for £139.

Uniqlo,"It really depends what you get from them tbh. I love them in the winter because their heavier knit sweaters and their coats are my favorites. I own several chunky knits from them that hold up well and don’t snag. I own a fur jacket that also is still perfected, and my favorite coat of all time is lined all the way through with fur and fits great. 

Their shoes are also wonderful. My favorite pair of Chelsea boots is from there and I’ve had them for a good 3/4 years. Still in great condition aside from it being super dirty. I also have their super chunky platform sneakers from this past season and they’re comfy and still in good condition, and I’ve worn them on long walks in NY. I have worse luck with their taller boots though, and they can be uncomfortable or just not fit certain calves. My calves aren’t even that big and they were not right. 

I haven’t gotten jeans from them in a while but the pants I’ve gotten are still great but can be annoying to wash. Some styles are also not friendly to thicker thighs, like mine. 

I love their dresses and have a plaid maxi I’ve had for about 2 years that’s still great. On the contrary, I have an oddly shaped boxy dress that is horrible. Zara sometimes has issues with silhouettes, and this dress is weird in that when you lift up your arms, it lifts up the whole dress and you see everything. It would work better as a tunic but still is largely unflattering. I also have several oversized hoodies which do fare much better but can still lay weirdly on the body. Some of their boxier cuts are bad, and I recommend if you’re like me and enjoy a boxy oversized fit, head over to somewhere like Uniqlo for that stuff. 

Their tees are a hit or miss. The fabric kinda sucks especially for their boxier tees with the cute prints, but they make for cute layering pieces. 

Their bags are also great. I have a few that have held up over the years with no issue. Can’t speak on their accessories as much sadly, but they have some lovely scarves. 

Zara’s more expensive pieces hold up well. Otherwise, it’s trendy garbage but it’s still a good way to experiment with styles and trends you’re not completely sold on. Their prices have changed a bit over the years sadly and it seems expensive for no reason, so I recommend going during the winter for coats and during the spring for dresses and shoes.

* Uniqlo linen button down - This was the year I got into button down shirts and cardigans. The linen fabric, loose fit, and pretty colors made me finally pull the trigger.
* Zara collared wool cardigan - I didn’t like wearing cardigans before, but was converted by the right weight, length, and details. It’s a great mid layer in the cold for me or a versatile outer piece in wildly fluctuating weather.

Worst
* Target square neck tank - this was a very trendy cut, but the fabric has some compression and always rode up.
* Target A New Day Seamless Jersey Tee - I got this synthetic top for working out because I was tired of my sweat soaked cotton tees, but this needed to size up because it rode up during workouts, and the fabric snags easily. I thought the snagging wouldn’t be a big deal since I wasn’t wearing this outside of workouts, but forgot about barbells and metal bars rubbing against it.

It is %100 cotton, good quality and fit. Also now in winter I can wear it with sweaters. I love the color, I understood the importance of choosing the right colors for myself.

3- Vintage black leather jacket from a thrift shop in Paris: It was 20 Euro, real leather, the fit is perfect. What can I say more.

1- High heel fisherman sandals from Zara: Hurts my feet so bad.

2- Mary Janes from Zara: Again with the first one the pair hurts my feet so bad. Plus I was initially going to buy a leather one from an actual shoe brand like Vagabond then I thought I saved money with this purchase. Plus it didn't end my want for Vagabond shoes so I will buy this year.

3- Beaded bag from zara: Beads were too sparkly, bag was not that big, didn't fit my outfits, bad quality, half of the beads in the handle fell off so I couldn't return it. I haven't wore this. not even once.

1. Uniqlo's Cashmere Beanie. I thankfully got this on sale, and of course $30 cashmere sounds too good to be true, but this thing is totally worthless. Air goes right through it and doesn't keep me warm at all. Significantly cheaper hats have kept me warmer. Waste of money.

I buy a lot of Old Navy and Gap brand products, and this was one of the worst items I've purchased from them. I wore it for a couple hours and it started piling immediately. It's unlined and, like the beanie above, the slightest breeze goes straight through it. It'll be fine for spring and fall I guess, but the immediate piling sucks.

I was in the market for a work laptop backpack and this one fits my ThinkPad like a glove. Very minimalist but surprisingly spacious enough to fit a full detached keyboard, charger, a notebook, pens, reading glasses, wallet, key and my tall thermo bottle.

2. Uniqlo U S/S 2023 denim oversized overshirt jacket in pale green color. The fit and color makes me so happy. It's my riding jacket in the spring/summer.

3. Vintage Escada wool pleated circle skirt. I'm petite, so it looks like a puffy maxi skirt on me. Wonderful shape, and versatile with sweaters. I do need to take it to the tailor to add an extra button for comfort.

Uniqlo,"Best: realistically, probably my Ugg fleece. Not really “fashion,” but does get a lot of use—maybe most worn in my wfh life?

1. Athleta Rainier Jogger. Just got them recently, and felt for them instantly. I never feel like pants flatter my body well without feeling like I look sloppy, but these look great and are super comfortable. 
2. Uniqlo's Heattech Sock, particularly [this style](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E460487-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=024). I always have cold feet, and these are so warm without being bulky. I really underestimated Heattech tbh. 
3. I'm putting a tie between my Adidas by Stella McCartney ASMC Sportswear 2000 Sneakers and my Teva Black ReEmber Loafers. Both are comfortable as hell.

Worst:

1. Uniqlo's Cashmere Beanie. I thankfully got this on sale, and of course $30 cashmere sounds too good to be true, but this thing is totally worthless. Air goes right through it and doesn't keep me warm at all. Significantly cheaper hats have kept me warmer. Waste of money. 
2. [This Old Navy coa](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=7520780320003&vid=1&searchText=coat#pdp-page-content)t. I mean, I got it for $23 on sale plus with coupons, so I can't really complain, but the quality is trash and it's a shame any piece of clothing is made this terribly. I buy a lot of Old Navy and Gap brand products, and this was one of the worst items I've purchased from them. I wore it for a couple hours and it started piling immediately. It's unlined and, like the beanie above, the slightest breeze goes straight through it. It'll be fine for spring and fall I guess, but the immediate piling sucks. Also, this purchase left me convinced Gap brands in general curate a lot of what the reviews say because 2k reviews and the average rating is 4.5 stars for *this* is wild.",0.04090136054421771,0.5313775510204081,mixed

* Uniqlo linen button down - This was the year I got into button down shirts and cardigans. The linen fabric, loose fit, and pretty colors made me finally pull the trigger.
* Zara collared wool cardigan - I didn’t like wearing cardigans before, but was converted by the right weight, length, and details. It’s a great mid layer in the cold for me or a versatile outer piece in wildly fluctuating weather.

* Target A New Day Seamless Jersey Tee - I got this synthetic top for working out because I was tired of my sweat soaked cotton tees, but this needed to size up because it rode up during workouts, and the fabric snags easily. I thought the snagging wouldn’t be a big deal since I wasn’t wearing this outside of workouts, but forgot about barbells and metal bars rubbing against it.

1. The Baggy Jean from Everlane. These just fit perfectly. They aren't too heavy, I love the extra high rise, and little bit of extra length in the leg. I'm normally not a fan of Everlane's denim but very glad I took a chance on these. 2. Seamless Plunge Bralette from The Gap. So comfy I bought every single color. Bonus points because I'm currently breastfeeding and these make better nursing bras than any of the actual nursing bras I've tried. 3. [This puffer](https://www.tentree.com/products/mid-length-unisex-puffer-olive-night-green) from Tentree. It's SO warm and has this extra fabric that comes down over your wrists so you don't get a draft up your arms. Also huge pockets.

Express Jeans! I was walking by a closing Express in the last 2 hours of them being open, I got a pair of jeans for $6 and they fit perfectly! :D What luck.

Worst: 1. Zadig and Voltaire shirts/sweaters. Too delicate and fall apart, broken straps on a tank top and the sweaters shrunk in the wash. If I lived alone I'd be able to have these, but with an SO, so I cannot. They don't look special enough to avoid the washer. 2. Heels, all of them. Idk why I buy them, they all hurt. 3.

Madewell low-top sneaker, pony hair in leopard print. I got these in a beat-up version for $6.99 at the thrift store and wore them to DEATH. By coincidence I found a new without tags version in my size in a consignment store and replaced them. They magically go with everything. 

Kule sweater [picture here](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/395964992252973894/) this was a pretty big splurge and risk, but it is a great item. High quality, interesting, always get compliments on it, and it goes with a surprising amount of items.

Those wore out recently, so this time around, I got the 90’s straight fit in the tall length and I am SO HAPPY with the fit. Didn’t have to get them tailored or anything.

These brands charge high prices so you'd expect some level of quality, but they're still selling polyester blouses for $90 and 20% wool blazers for $260. I thrifted a pair of Mother jeans and they're... fine? But it's insane that they're originally $230.

Above that price range, quality starts to actually improve rather than being marked up for no reason. The quality of real designer clothing is absolutely unmatched, unfortunately enough. And below that price range you'll get mediocre clothes but at least you're paying a more accurate price for it.

Gap,"I have been disappointed by almost all of the nicer brands. Brand name is no substitute for knowing how to tell quality. The most disappointing ones however are:

**Frame** - Nothing I have from this has ever lasted better than say, GAP

**Tory Burch shoes** - My other TB items are great, but her shoes are miraculously consistently shitty. Definitely more $50-$70 shoes than $200+ shoes.

**Anthropologie** - *makes wide gestures* Anthropologie stocks a combination of their own brand and many other brands. It’s not cheap, and in my 20s it was my “fancy” store. Like save my money and splurge on something nice from *anthropologie* oh la la. And by now I have bought everything from clothes to kitchenware to furniture from there. I quit it in 2016 when I bought a [thousand dollar coffee table](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/boutonniere-coffee-table?quantity=1) that arrived 5 months late with yellowing and chipped marble out of the box. I’m still cranky about that.

**Everlane** - I have heard legends about the first 3 years of Everlane, and everything since has been “did I really pay this much -not on sale- for it?”

**Theory** - When I was a baby lawyer, this was my first big girl brand (along with Anthropologie for the casual side). The good thing about it was that at the time, it was the only accessible (in terms of like, in stock at the department store) brand that made me feel slim and modern. The bad thing about it is that it’s not really worth the price.

**M.M.La Fleur** - When I finally grew out of Theory, got tired of work-life-balance to the point of never wanting to dry clean again, MM came out with the jardigan and the washable workset. The good thing was … well, the jardigan. The bad thing was paying $200-300 for a polyester top.",0.09632352941176472,0.5512254901960785,mixed

Madewell,"Honestly, I've found that most ""nicer brands"" in the $100-300 price range aren't worth it at *all.* Madewell and Everlane as others are saying, but also Aritzia, Anthropologie, COS. These brands charge high prices so you'd expect some level of quality, but they're still selling polyester blouses for $90 and 20% wool blazers for $260. I thrifted a pair of Mother jeans and they're... fine? But it's insane that they're originally $230.

Above that price range, quality starts to actually improve rather than being marked up for no reason. The quality of real designer clothing is absolutely unmatched, unfortunately enough. And below that price range you'll get mediocre clothes but at least you're paying a more accurate price for it.

The only store I buy new from these days is Uniqlo and I will never stop praising them. Otherwise I just buy vintage and I highly recommend everyone else to do the same.",0.10704906204906207,0.5448989898989899,positive

My top recommendation is jeans, if you can find your perfect fit. I like how many options they have, and they literally never bag out on me.

Currently on sale, but only in a limited number of sizes. It tends to come and go (I stalked it for ages before buying).

I originally ordered an XL since some reviews said it ran tiny and FWIW there was quite a bit of difference between those sizes. To give you an idea, it was enough of a difference that L is t-shirt only and XL would have given me room to button it up over my bulkiest sweaters without a problem at all.

Gap,"At the start of 2021, I posted a now-deleted post talking about my style over 4 years, during which I’d taken 550+ outfit photos. Well, now it’s been over 3 years, and I have 400 more outfit photos and even more thoughts on fashion and style.

From November 2016 to December 2023, I’ve taken 957 outfits photos. [**These are my top 10 outfits for each season, for each year I’ve catalogued**](https://imgur.com/dJ4ZWXW).

I was 25 when I first posted in FFA - [**Posted on 6 November 2016, this was my first ever WAYWT post,**](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/5bget0/waywt_november_06_2016/d9pbxss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) over 7 years ago.

For context, I’m now 33. In that time I’ve moved countries (and back again), kicked a horrifying shopping habit, had a few different hairstyles (always messy), travelled, gained and lost weight, obvs a global pandemic, as well as a few job changes. All of this has had an impact on how I dress and how I feel towards fashion.

&#x200B;

[**2016 - 2017: 26 & 27 years old,**](https://imgur.com/VwFYboC) **Melbourne AU**

* Started off with casual, relaxed silhouettes before gravitating towards more structured, feminine silhouettes in 2017
* Almost exclusively wore skirts and dress for the better part of a year and didn’t start wearing pants and jeans until second half of 2017
* Started off wearing more colour before going more neutral by the end of 2017
* Became more exposed to fashion via social media (this was the start of a shopping addiction that lasted until 2019)

&#x200B;

[**2018: 28 yo,**](https://imgur.com/mh7pJ8t) **Melbourne AU**

* Height of my shopping addiction (was buying multiple items of clothing every week)
* Style leaned towards boho during S/S, no idea what was going on during A/W (I blame this on a shopping addiction)
* Actively consuming fashion content daily and trying to mimic what I saw
* Near the end of 2018, tried to curb my excessive shopping habit (failing more than succeeding)

&#x200B;

[**2019: 29 yo,**](https://imgur.com/FYJRM3C) **London UK**

* Moved to London (as well as moving flats 4 times)
* Started re-wearing clothes more
* Started focusing more on functionality of my wardrobe (i.e. sneakers and outerwear)
* Decreasing how much fashion content I follow
* Started properly kicking my shopping addiction for real

&#x200B;

[**2020: 30 yo,**](https://imgur.com/tbIQ2aj) London UK

* Subconsciously lost weight, so now dressing to a different(ish) body
* Style developed more retro elements
* Buying less, buying smarter and buying second-hand more (a lot of my wardrobe at that times was either at least 1 year old, was bought second-hand or as direct replacements for old items)
* Was experimenting more with the clothes I had
* Completely stopped following any fashion content
* First time I feel like S/S me matches A/W me, whereas I’ve always felt disjointed across seasons in previous years

&#x200B;

[**2021: 31 yo,**](https://imgur.com/n53wuVI) London UK & Melbourne AU

* Moved back to Melbourne, Australia mid-year
* Switched to primarily buying secondhand when I moved back
* Style is just an extension of 2020 (went without 80% of my wardrobe from July to October as it was being shipped back to me, hence the big gap in outfit photos)
* Started getting more experimental with clothes at the end of the year – what can be worn backwards? Can this dress be worn as a skirt? Can this top be worn as skirt?
* Went back on instagram (but this time being very specific with what fashion content I consume)

&#x200B;

[**2022: 32 yo,**](https://imgur.com/auudpZk) Melbourne AU

* Decided to start my own biz (which meant glorious freedom in how I dress)
* Rediscovering what proper summer dressing was
* Style was quite feminine for most of the year, leaning more towards skirts/dresses for the first half of the year before gradually moving more towards pants by end of the year
* Overall style became more tamed down compared to 2020/2021 as a result of being back in Melbourne for a while (far more casual city than London is)
* New styles/trends I gravitated towards were calf/knee high boots, untucked tops, baguette bags, scarf tops (my love!)

&#x200B;

[**2023: 33 yo,**](https://imgur.com/h1HBbeV) Melbourne AU

* Went back into full-time work (sometimes solo businesses don’t work out and that’s okay)
* Fell off the wagon of buying mostly 2nd hand before getting back on it end of the year
* Mixing up casual elements with dressy elements more (e.g. Docs with silky dresses, dressy tops with jeans, open shirts over crop tops, etc)
* Gravitating back to neutrals and muted colours
* Heavily favouring crop tops, asymmetric necklines and details, and full-length pants
* My vintage designer bag era (call me a collector)

**This isn’t for the impatient**

If it wasn’t obvious, my current style didn’t happen overnight. In fact, it’s almost 15 years of actively taking an interest in fashion (from 18 yo; I’m now 33), experimenting with clothing and ***a ton*** of mistakes and learning. It’s also still a work-in-progress, and will continue to change as I get older because people evolve with age. Style isn’t timeless, but your attitude is.

For anyone truly interested in fashion and wanting to develop their own sense of style, the thing you need most is something you don’t actually need to buy – it’s patience. No one was ever born instantly fashionable or stylish or trendy or whatever. No one ever suddenly, out of the blue, knew how to dress themselves. That person whose style you admire? Guaranteed it’s something they’ve been honing for years. Even more guaranteed they have worn outfits that would make you howl (with fondness).

Just like with any hobby, it’s something that develops over time.


&#x200B;

**I don’t hyper label myself**

I very much used to identify as solely boho, polished, trendy and feminine (as evidenced by my 2018 period). Sometimes I still do. But I no longer actively try and emulate those all the time and in every outfit.

Sometimes labelling works for people to really concentrate on what clothes they want to buy. But it’s also okay if that’s not for you. It wasn’t for me; in fact, it actually made me feel restricted. I felt I could only dress a certain way, which led me to feeling bored and resulted in a horrible shopping habit – like the only way for me to keep dressing this way was to…buy more clothes. *Hello, shopping addiction!* You took almost 3 years of my life, ya lil fucker.

These days, I vaguely think of my style as just feminine and dressy-meets-casual, and not much beyond that. In almost all of my non-occasion outfits, you’ll find:

* *A feminine element* – A stereotypically femme item (dresses and skirts), an emphasis on waist or legs (very fitted silhouettes and/or mini lengths), or a bit of bare skin
* *A dressy element* – Dressy fabrics (e.g. silk, satin or fur), bias cut silhouettes, little handbags, or heeled and/or pointed toe shoes
* *A casual element* – Casual fabrics (denim, soft cotton, linen), slouchy/oversized silhouettes (particularly with outerwear and knitwear), chunky shoes, or messy hair and very natural makeup

It allows me to know what kind of clothing I want in my wardrobe, but doesn’t overly restrict me. By breaking it down to broad elements, I still have freedom to include pattern and colour, to experiment with different styles, and to incorporate trends that I like (or avoid trends that I don’t).


&#x200B;

**I stopped obsessing over every single detail**

2017 & 2018 are interesting years for me because those were the years I was never fully satisfied with my outfits. And the reason for that was because I was consumed with wanting every aspect of my outfit to be perfect. Does this jacket perfectly complement this dress? Does my outfit exactly portray the vibe I want? Does this dress emphasise my waist in the best possible way? Have I tucked this top perfectly? Have I incorporated enough texture and different materials or have I done too much? Am I dressed exactly for the occasion and event?

It’s actually really bloody exhausting and extremely restrictive. I’d second guess every choice I made, I’d keep buying more clothes because I felt like something else could be just that little bit better, I’d limit myself to certain styles because I had rigid rules on what looked good and what suited me. I could never really enjoy my clothes or feel confident in my appearance.

These days, it’s no longer about perfection. Some days my jeans don’t sit exactly how I want, or I’m dressed plain enough that you couldn’t pick me out of a crowd, or my legs look a bit stumpy, or my clothes are wrinkled. Overthinking every aspect of my outfit has me second guessing myself which leads to those moments of ‘I have nothing to wear’. It’s a hell of a lot more freeing when you accept good enough really is more than good enough.


&#x200B;

**Nothing is black and white (even if a lot of your wardrobe is)**

I joke that my fashion motto is, ‘Can you dress it up or down?’ Because truly, can you dress it up or down?

Clothes to me are not something that serves only one purpose or should be worn only one way. I am a massive champion for versatility, so I’m always trying to find ways my clothes can be, of course, worn both casually and for special occasions, in multiple seasons, layered under or over other items, worn backwards, or worn in others ways (dresses as a skirts, scarf as tops, etc).

When I was a little kid, I loved wearing my yukata to obon festivals and to ""international day"" at school and that kind of thing, but I feel like the Japanese people that want to wear yukatas for appropriate events already have them.

I did receive a nice yukata as a present the following year, and in those ~10 years I have worn these things maybe 5 times (one has flowers so I'd wear that to Sakura Matsuri and the other has fireworks that I would wear to a non-flower-viewing festival).  Not very practical at all, but it was nice to have one on those occasions.  People who don't recognize it from Uniqlo do think the Uniqlo one looks good, however...the material is even a little lighter than my non-Uniqlo one, which is nice in humid summers.

Zara,"I don’t know if it’s just me and being a mid 30s curmudgeon, but is anyone else getting increasingly frustrated with some clothing sites (Anthropologie, Zara, and at times Nordstroms to name a few) with the bizarre modeling poses that are happening that seem to be taking away the focus from what is important....the actual clothing? 

Maybe it’s just fashion and pushing the envelope and maybe I’m just a country bumpkin from the mountains of Idaho, but I seriously get so annoyed when I see this. I don’t know how a shirt fully looks if the model is doing the running man dance in the snapshots and I don’t know how a coat will truly look on me when all the photos are frantic action shots of this gorgeous woman mid snowball fight with her hot husband and the coat just seems to be an afterthought. 

I’m obviously exaggerating here and clearly not every website is like this. But just today I was looking at this sweater online and trying to decide if I wanted to purchase it and like 4 out of the 6 shots were of the model laying down on her stomach on her bed in a sexy pose while hiding half of the product the company is actually trying to sell! I honestly forgot what I was even shopping for cause I was too distracted by the pictures. To sum it up basically I just wish every model would pose like a mugshot photo where they just stand blankly at the camera and that’s it. I just feel like with online shopping there is always a risk cause you can’t try the clothes on and I wish that the photographers would understand that.

Zara,"Photographer here, fashion and catalogue work isn't my main area of expertise but I have done some of it. Most often, if a photographer is shooting one of those poses it's because the garment won't look good otherwise. Clipping, pinning and modifying clothes for fashion shoots is out of style, for whatever reason (at least partly because they don't want to pay an expert to do it) and so it's left to the photographer and model to make do with the garment they are provided with. The plague of strangely-posed fashion photography is the result. The more that just isn't working, the less of the garment I can get away with having visible in the resulting photograph, and photoshop can only fix so much. A brand that can't afford to bring in a clothes stylist is hardly going to shell out for the hours of work a photoshop artist would spend making it look like a clothes stylist was there. A lot of more expensive brands are still doing decent photos, since they have an easier time justifying the budget for a clothing stylist along with the photographer, makeup artist, hairstylist and outfit consultant that they haven't managed to find a way to do without yet (though the outfit consultant is on their way out too - go look at a Zara catalogue and count the photos where they have gone out of their way to find a way not to include any garments other than the one being advertised.) The ""edgy"" and ""modern"" poses are a way of making a cheap way of hiding imperfections to look on-trend and intentional.

Edited to add: a clothing stylist can only fix so much, if something is too short or too tight or the pants have a camel toe there is only so much they can do. Clothing stylists work absolute magic and I am constantly in awe of them, but they don't have a magic wand to add fabric where there isn't any. So on top of saving the money of hiring one, the edgy poses are often hiding fit issues that would have most clothing stylists I've talked to say ""what do you expect me to do with this?"" 

That said, pretty much every brand either uses clothing stylists or asks their photographers and models to hide things a clothing stylist would be working on. Fashion photography is supposed to make the garment look *better than* real life. That is the industry-accepted best practice. If I was shooting a dress shirt and asked the fashion stylist to take the pins out of the waist because I want to show the buyer ""what they are really getting"", the brand would go get themselves a different photographer because that isn't my job, my job is to make the shirt look as good as it can. A garment that is as close to perfect as can be bought off the rack can still be improved by a couple of clips in the right places by an expert just to make it look like it was tailored to this particular model, using a clothing stylist or edgy posing doesn't mean something is wrong with the garment.

Zara,"Dear Fashion Industry,

I’ve fallen out of love with you, and I’m going to tell you why. First you should know that I’ve loved you for a very long time, since I was a little girl insisting on picking out her own clothes. As a teenager I avidly collected copies of Teen Vogue and pasted pages on my walls. I cared very much about what I wear, and at almost 26 I still do. But lately, you’ve brought me less joy and more frustration and discomfort. The older I’ve become, you see, the harder it is to ignore your ugly side. I’ve read the articles and the exposés, and now I know about the cost of fast fashion I can’t go back to not knowing. I don’t want to shop at places that exploit adults and children, and that plagiarize independent creators. 

This leads me to my other problem: I can’t afford not to. I’m broke, and while I know that’s not your fault, Fashion Industry, maybe you should care that I’m broke because a huge portion of my generation is also broke. Really broke actually, and it looks like we are going to be broke for a while. Speaking of my generation, we have also been at the forefront of the rise of social media, of fashion and beauty influencers, and of a perhaps unprecedented level of consumerism. Every day I am blasted with images that tell me what I need to have right now. I see influencers uploading haul after haul of free goods (sent by you, Fashion Industry) or impulse purchases, and then uploading clear-out after clear-out of the same clothes with labels still attached. Inside, I struggle between buying into aspirational envy, feeling dismayed that I can’t afford to update my own wardrobe so frequently, and being uncomfortable with the huge amounts of waste portrayed. Regardless of which emotion wins, I ultimately end up just feeling depressed.

Even if I ignore trends and aim for a timeless, ethical and high quality wardrobe of ‘investment’ pieces, I would still need to have the money to invest in the first place. I’d like to be able to save a whole year for one or two items of clothing, but the reality is that in that time my clothes wear out, my weight fluctuates, and I need a dress to wear to that family member’s wedding. So as I see it, I’m left with only a few options. I can put ethics aside, feign ignorance and shop fast fashion, but Zara charges $70 for a top I know was probably made by a child labourer and that will fall apart in 10 washes. $70 seems like a very high price to pay for a blouse with that kind of baggage: I can’t afford that in more ways than one. I could shop at second hand retailers, which I have been doing in increasing amounts over the last few years, but that’s exhausting and I don’t usually end up with the thing I was hoping to find. The best thrift store I’ve found, the only one selling clothes other than second hand H&M pieces priced just a couple of dollars lower than they retailed for in store, is well over an hour and a half’s drive away. My other option, then, is to make my own clothes. Last year for my birthday I asked for a sewing machine  with that exact intention. But fabric is expensive, sewing takes time, and a lot of practice is required to result in quality garments that fit well and look good. I’m still working on this option, but I’ve yet to make a garment good enough to wear. 

So what do I do? So far, a bit of all of these options. Sometimes I blinker my ethics and reach for the fast fashion sale rack in shame. Sometimes I make the drive to that thrift store and cross my fingers I’ll find something there. Sometimes I look on pattern websites and see if I can find modern, relevant patterns that won’t be too hard to follow. Mostly I just haunt Uniqlo, trying to convince myself that it’s not *true* fast fashion as its clothes are better quality and still in my price range. 

You might say, Fashion Industry, that I’m doing a lot of complaining. You might say I should find a well paying job so I can afford ethical, good quality fashion - believe me, that’s the goal. You might say that all of the above options are doable and I should stop whining and accept my lot. For the most part, I try to do that. This letter, you see, isn’t born from a desire to *complain*. Instead it’s born from a desire to *explain*. As I said at the beginning, Fashion Industry, I don’t really love you anymore and this is why. Clothes, shoes, accessories — things that have brought me joy my whole life now come with a lot of other emotions instead. Fashion makes me stressed, makes me anxious, makes me pity myself, makes me envious, makes me wasteful, makes me feel depressed. I can no longer enjoy clothes because I’m caught in a conflicted whirlwind of ethics and consumerism. 

I’ve loved you my whole life, but I’ve realized I put a lot of time and money and energy into this relationship and don’t get a whole lot back. Perhaps I’ll learn to love you again, but first I have to change some things about myself. Maybe I’ll monitor my time on Instagram, unfollow the influencers who pull me into their world of consumerism and aspiration. Maybe I’ll get better at sewing and find other thrift stores. Maybe I’ll learn to balance my desire to look and feel good, with my desire to be a conscientious consumer. But even if I change those things about myself, Fashion Industry, I don’t think I’ll ever fully love you again until you make some changes too. 

I really wish I could still love you, but these days you just make me sad.

You hit the nail on the head with this. I'm really confused about why /u/GigiMP says she ""can't afford not to"" shop at Zara/H&M because she's broke.

And I'm not going to debate the relativity of ethics, although I think we can agree on a minimum set of standards we could discuss, such as living wage specific to the country. Lots of industries have issues with ethical production. That doesn't mean we shouldn't care about fashion's issues.

>And paying $70 for a top is kinda over priced, but we allow ourselves to make it seem like it is a normal price.

This is where things get a little complicated for me. It's overpriced for a Zara shirt, absolutely. But the factors that go into pricing are more complicated than the cost of materials and even the cost of production. Stores have to take into account the cost of the entire supply chain, transportation on every rung, and with the current expectation of consumers to be able to ship everything speedily and return anything, you also have to take into account returned goods you can't sell. Again, not saying that $70 Zara top is worth the money, but there are factors that lead for a top to be priced that much. Which maybe highlights how ridiculous it is for Forever21 or H&M to have the prices they do.

It leads to a kind of terrible situation where a lot of people have no choice but to buy fast fashion (or thrift, if they're lucky to have good options and the time) because that's all that's in their price point; every other place isn't operating at a scale where they can streamline the process. So while I'm sympathetic to the OP's post, it's also not necessarily possible for everyone to quit fast fashion. And while changing consumer habits can help change the industry's practices, most of the effective change is going to have to come from legislation.

Even in Chinatown in the US, things are pretty expensive, since they have US living costs and rental. 

I think tailoring skills are extremely rare in the US, and I doubt that there are even a small amount of people who are spending 4-8 hours working on a top (it requires pretty specialized skills) and then selling it for $70.

I can put ethics aside, feign ignorance and shop fast fashion, but Zara charges $70 for a top I know was probably made by a child labourer and that will fall apart in 10 washes. $70 seems like a very high price to pay for a blouse with that kind of baggage: I can’t afford that in more ways than one. I could shop at second hand retailers, which I have been doing in increasing amounts over the last few years, but that’s exhausting and I don’t usually end up with the thing I was hoping to find. The best thrift store I’ve found, the only one selling clothes other than second hand H&M pieces priced just a couple of dollars lower than they retailed for in store, is well over an hour and a half’s drive away. My other option, then, is to make my own clothes. Last year for my birthday I asked for a sewing machine  with that exact intention. But fabric is expensive, sewing takes time, and a lot of practice is required to result in quality garments that fit well and look good. I’m still working on this option, but I’ve yet to make a garment good enough to wear. 

So what do I do? So far, a bit of all of these options. Sometimes I blinker my ethics and reach for the fast fashion sale rack in shame. Sometimes I make the drive to that thrift store and cross my fingers I’ll find something there. Sometimes I look on pattern websites and see if I can find modern, relevant patterns that won’t be too hard to follow. Mostly I just haunt Uniqlo, trying to convince myself that it’s not *true* fast fashion as its clothes are better quality and still in my price range. 

You might say, Fashion Industry, that I’m doing a lot of complaining. You might say I should find a well paying job so I can afford ethical, good quality fashion - believe me, that’s the goal. You might say that all of the above options are doable and I should stop whining and accept my lot. For the most part, I try to do that. This letter, you see, isn’t born from a desire to *complain*. Instead it’s born from a desire to *explain*. As I said at the beginning, Fashion Industry, I don’t really love you anymore and this is why. Clothes, shoes, accessories — things that have brought me joy my whole life now come with a lot of other emotions instead. Fashion makes me stressed, makes me anxious, makes me pity myself, makes me envious, makes me wasteful, makes me feel depressed. I can no longer enjoy clothes because I’m caught in a conflicted whirlwind of ethics and consumerism. 

I’ve loved you my whole life, but I’ve realized I put a lot of time and money and energy into this relationship and don’t get a whole lot back. Perhaps I’ll learn to love you again, but first I have to change some things about myself. Maybe I’ll monitor my time on Instagram, unfollow the influencers who pull me into their world of consumerism and aspiration. Maybe I’ll get better at sewing and find other thrift stores. Maybe I’ll learn to balance my desire to look and feel good, with my desire to be a conscientious consumer. But even if I change those things about myself, Fashion Industry, I don’t think I’ll ever fully love you again until you make some changes too. 

I really wish I could still love you, but these days you just make me sad.

H&M,"I am really actively working on honing my personal style, but I will say that making clothing (and crafting skills in general) really helps me feel better about my consumption. In 2018 I purchased no clothing. In 2019, I am purchasing only used clothing. I live in a small college town in the midwest, so thrift stores are limited to mostly Target /H&M/Forever 21 or Vineyard Vines stuff. But because of my crafting ability, I can make statement pieces to add to my basics that I can scrounge up at the thrift store.
 
A few weeks ago, for instance, I made an olive green shag yarn jacket. I could never in a thousand years find something like that second hand, and I would feel guilty spending over $100 on the one I wanted. Making it allows me to have that control and not so much the guilt. I have been crocheting for 8 years, sewing for 6, and embroidery here and there. Fabric is expensive, but I feel so much better spending $50 on materials (frequently second hand too, actually) and being able to control the outcome, than contributing to fast fashion. It takes a while, I am still not completely happy with everything that comes off my machine, but I really encourage you to stick with it. Time and patience will help you too.

You hit the nail on the head with this. I'm really confused about why /u/GigiMP says she ""can't afford not to"" shop at Zara/H&M because she's broke. That is some *ridiculous* first world problem BS. If you're broke, you need to understand that fashion is a luxury. If you truly believe that the ethical treatment of human beings is more important than you looking chic (and, frankly, it is), maybe it's time for you to stop caring about fashion (I know that's the gist of this post). It's completely doable. No one is actually forcing your hand to shop there, you basically just have FOMO. It's still your choice and you *do* have control over your actions. You are not required to surround yourself by ads and social media. That is all 100% choice. In fact, most people who ditch social media seem to be much happier for it.

H&M,"I mean, it definitely can work, but I think a lot of people have brand-blinders when it comes to how an item actually looks. There is a ton of utter crap on Poshmark, and most of the good stuff is priced 30-40% below retail, which is similar to shopping sales or outlet stores, and at least there you can return it if it doesn’t work out. I’m not saying brick and mortar is a good solution, because the in-store options are often limited, but favorable return policies and not constantly chasing a better deal have greatly reduced my shopping anxiety from when I was spending time trying to find “better” things on Poshmark.

I also question individual definitions of “designer” and “mid-range”, and how overall budget fits in to people’s Poshmark experiences. I feel like Equipment and Theory are good examples of brands that may be considered designer or mid range, depending on your world-view. The quality jump from H&M or even Banana Republic to those brands is significant, and sizing is somewhat comparable. However the quality jump from those brands to say, St. John or Escada is slightly less obvious (not saying it isn’t there, but it def isn’t as glaring), and you are missing out in the styling and sizing advice (because European/designer sizing can be tricky) that would normally accompany these items if you were purchasing at a retailer. Plus, you’re still paying a significant amount of money for an item that may or may not be authentic, may or may not fit, and is probably an older style.  Not worth the stress to me.

And I'm not going to debate the relativity of ethics, although I think we can agree on a minimum set of standards we could discuss, such as living wage specific to the country. Lots of industries have issues with ethical production. That doesn't mean we shouldn't care about fashion's issues.

>And paying $70 for a top is kinda over priced, but we allow ourselves to make it seem like it is a normal price.

This is where things get a little complicated for me. It's overpriced for a Zara shirt, absolutely. But the factors that go into pricing are more complicated than the cost of materials and even the cost of production. Stores have to take into account the cost of the entire supply chain, transportation on every rung, and with the current expectation of consumers to be able to ship everything speedily and return anything, you also have to take into account returned goods you can't sell. Again, not saying that $70 Zara top is worth the money, but there are factors that lead for a top to be priced that much. Which maybe highlights how ridiculous it is for Forever21 or H&M to have the prices they do.

It leads to a kind of terrible situation where a lot of people have no choice but to buy fast fashion (or thrift, if they're lucky to have good options and the time) because that's all that's in their price point; every other place isn't operating at a scale where they can streamline the process. So while I'm sympathetic to the OP's post, it's also not necessarily possible for everyone to quit fast fashion. And while changing consumer habits can help change the industry's practices, most of the effective change is going to have to come from legislation.

Uniqlo,"Dear Fashion Industry,

I’ve fallen out of love with you, and I’m going to tell you why. First you should know that I’ve loved you for a very long time, since I was a little girl insisting on picking out her own clothes. As a teenager I avidly collected copies of Teen Vogue and pasted pages on my walls. I cared very much about what I wear, and at almost 26 I still do. But lately, you’ve brought me less joy and more frustration and discomfort. The older I’ve become, you see, the harder it is to ignore your ugly side. I’ve read the articles and the exposés, and now I know about the cost of fast fashion I can’t go back to not knowing. I don’t want to shop at places that exploit adults and children, and that plagiarize independent creators. 

This leads me to my other problem: I can’t afford not to. I’m broke, and while I know that’s not your fault, Fashion Industry, maybe you should care that I’m broke because a huge portion of my generation is also broke. Really broke actually, and it looks like we are going to be broke for a while. Speaking of my generation, we have also been at the forefront of the rise of social media, of fashion and beauty influencers, and of a perhaps unprecedented level of consumerism. Every day I am blasted with images that tell me what I need to have right now. I see influencers uploading haul after haul of free goods (sent by you, Fashion Industry) or impulse purchases, and then uploading clear-out after clear-out of the same clothes with labels still attached. Inside, I struggle between buying into aspirational envy, feeling dismayed that I can’t afford to update my own wardrobe so frequently, and being uncomfortable with the huge amounts of waste portrayed. Regardless of which emotion wins, I ultimately end up just feeling depressed.

Even if I ignore trends and aim for a timeless, ethical and high quality wardrobe of ‘investment’ pieces, I would still need to have the money to invest in the first place. I’d like to be able to save a whole year for one or two items of clothing, but the reality is that in that time my clothes wear out, my weight fluctuates, and I need a dress to wear to that family member’s wedding. So as I see it, I’m left with only a few options.

Uniqlo,"I'm a little bit older than you and have gone through every single stage you describe, including sewing lessons (which were expensive but I thought would be an investment - I quit when I realized even the instructors' garments looked obviously handmade and not in an endearing way). Most of my wardrobe is still Uniqlo. 

You laid out the conundrum of ethical consumption so elegantly here. I hope more people not only start to acknowledge this problem, but also to internalize the bigger implications as you have. 

I doubt my personal coping mechanism will catch on in this sub, but for what it's worth... I've basically moved on to a sort of fashion austerity. I only wear makeup occasionally, I got a buzz cut I can maintain myself, and I did manage to save up for things like high quality boots. My outer appearance no longer reflects all the nuance of how I feel from year to year, season to season. Sometimes it's perfect, sometimes it's uncomfortably androgynous. Sometimes it feels uncomfortably plain. But it remains true to a deeper part of me as I get older and face harsher realities. After reconciling my younger self's vision for my future with the lived realities of housing scarcity, income instability, rapid climate change, and the fact that I can't afford to have children/likely never will, the sacrifices I've made in fashion choice seem so insignificant for the peace of mind that comes from living what I believe (as much as possible in the context of global capitalism anyway).

Zara,"You have to acknowledge that people, once aware of the problem, are all going to have different levels of trying to contribute to the solution based on their own economic needs and situations. Blanket judging people who buy fast fashion while refusing to acknowledge there IS inherent privilege in shopping ethically is a problem. Judge the people who vocally don't give a fuuuu about buying it, but understand not everyone with a Walmart, Zara, Shein top on their body is recklessly consuming.

150 items at 20 bucks a pop is 3,000 bucks, which if you have only 15 items of clothing is around 200 dollars an item, which is less than a reformation dress, around the cost of a Madewell pair of jeans, etc.

Thats 3000 dollars you've (I am using the general you during all this, I know nothing about your exact closet) been able to spend on your wardrobe in much bigger chunks of money at once than someone building a wardrobe of 10 to 30 dollar pieces at once, so that IS objectively a privilege. 

The fact that upfront cost of pieces is much more at an ethical brand is also a problem for low income people, because they can't drop 200 dollars on an item at once if its a necessity or needs replacing etc, thus kind of stuck in a cycle of buying and replacing low cost items because they cant afford to save for the upfront costs of a good item. Boots Theory of socioeconomic unfairness, essentially.

Also, thrifting is NOT an option in lots of poor rural communities because there are no thrift stores, no one to drive low income country folk without a car or public transport, and these people can't take time off work to go to thrift stores during sometimes restrictive hours. Often, if you do have a store in a small town, it's a Goodwill stocked with local donations of, gues s what, lower quality clothes. So, no matter how ethical they're being by thrifting, they still get judged by people like you for having a Walmart shirt on their bodies, it seems. Having access to thrifting options with good ethically made clothing, and having the ability to go, IS objectively a privilege.

Additionally, if you online thrift, you MUST be taking into account the extremely wasteful global shipping industry you are contributing to, I'm sure. Having reliable internet to shop IS also a privilege, I know many rural communities that dont have it. So, again, you're stil contributing to a large scale economically fraught problem.

If you buy a 100% etchically made chemical free fair trade hemp sweater, it costs an outrageous amount of money and because its so rare, the shipping to your home country might not exist or costs as much as the original item.

Madewell,"You have to acknowledge that people, once aware of the problem, are all going to have different levels of trying to contribute to the solution based on their own economic needs and situations. Blanket judging people who buy fast fashion while refusing to acknowledge there IS inherent privilege in shopping ethically is a problem. Judge the people who vocally don't give a fuuuu about buying it, but understand not everyone with a Walmart, Zara, Shein top on their body is recklessly consuming.

150 items at 20 bucks a pop is 3,000 bucks, which if you have only 15 items of clothing is around 200 dollars an item, which is less than a reformation dress, around the cost of a Madewell pair of jeans, etc.

Thats 3000 dollars you've (I am using the general you during all this, I know nothing about your exact closet) been able to spend on your wardrobe in much bigger chunks of money at once than someone building a wardrobe of 10 to 30 dollar pieces at once, so that IS objectively a privilege. 

The fact that upfront cost of pieces is much more at an ethical brand is also a problem for low income people, because they can't drop 200 dollars on an item at once if its a necessity or needs replacing etc, thus kind of stuck in a cycle of buying and replacing low cost items because they cant afford to save for the upfront costs of a good item. Boots Theory of socioeconomic unfairness, essentially.

Also, thrifting is NOT an option in lots of poor rural communities because there are no thrift stores, no one to drive low income country folk without a car or public transport, and these people can't take time off work to go to thrift stores during sometimes restrictive hours. Often, if you do have a store in a small town, it's a Goodwill stocked with local donations of, gues s what, lower quality clothes. So, no matter how ethical they're being by thrifting, they still get judged by people like you for having a Walmart shirt on their bodies, it seems. Having access to thrifting options with good ethically made clothing, and having the ability to go, IS objectively a privilege.

Additionally, if you online thrift, you MUST be taking into account the extremely wasteful global shipping industry you are contributing to, I'm sure. Having reliable internet to shop IS also a privilege, I know many rural communities that dont have it. So, again, you're stil contributing to a large scale economically fraught problem.

And don't call someone out for coming for you (this is the specific use of you) while assuming they're not doing anything to contribute themselves...that's bizarre: to get mad at someone for assuming something about you, then come back with an assumption yourself?

Anyway, she uses about 90% natural fibers, has exceptionally high quality production practices, and just overall I find the cut + textiles to be super comfortable.

Gap,"Great idea for a post OP! I know this is a bit old but thought this might help someone to add my experience. 

Canadian currently living in USA - hoping this will help anyone thinking of ordering anything online - I know how annoying it is to find great denim in some places in Canada and missing out on sales that seem to only happen South of the border! 

My HG jeans are COH Liya in Sunday Morning which I got at Aritzia in Canada - size 27 (tight when bought, perfect now). I have never liked Levi's (didn't like the wedgie, i think it's called), wasn't huge on Madewell, most AGOLDE have not been great for me either (no room for thighs).  I almost exclusively wear non-stretch 97-100% cotton.  I also have the issue of too small for legs/hips and too big in the waist! 

Since moving to the US, I have tried on MANY COH and AGOLDE and also some Madewell and Everlane. Just a word of warning - sizing is all over the place for both COH and AGOLDE IMO. 

I tried on several COH OLIVIA pairs, including the 3rd place listed here which was honestly one of the best fitting pairs I have ever tried, but I didn't like the showing button fly (Olivia in Licorice, size 27, was perfect!) - but many many other Olivia in size 27 were so small I honestly would have needed a 29 to come close to buttons coming together. I have the Olivia Crop in 'Glance' (very very light blue) - which is not 'premium line' - size 27 is perfect. But the Olivia 'medium blue denim' ones from anthro were so small in 27, there was a 3-4inch gap between top buttons. I tried on what appeared to be the same Olivia ones in med blue ('circa' colour maybe?) at another store here in a 28, and they were much too big (needed 27). Tried on a few other ones at club monaco here, similar finding - one colour in 28 was too small (needed 29) another colour fit in the 27, both Olivia. I can't recall if those were 'premium' or not, but honestly they all had similar thickness and very little stretch. 

I also tried the Emery high rise in straight crop ('rose blue' I think, they were a medium blue). Tried them on at a store, perfect in 27 but didn't buy. Found on sale later online in same colour, ordered 27, and they were so big in the waist I think maybe I could have fit into a 25 (unheard of for me), but didn't re-order a 26 since I wasn't sure if it would fit like the pair I tried on in store... again sizing all over the place. 

I also had a similar experience with AGOLDE. I tried on and loved the Riley high rise straight crop (in 'SCENE') in a 27 and this one was probably the best fit I have ever had (room for bottom and fitted all the way around waist) - it seemed like they were custom made for me. But I didn't buy as I wanted to wait for sale - bought on sale from same store (mailed to me since store had no 27) and they were so small, no room for me below the waist, and so tiny at the waist the top button I could barely manage to get it shut. I sadly have to return and not sure if I want to re-order since I'm not sure if I should try for another 27, or a 28 or maybe 29 even...  

&#x200B;

Everlane - love the cheeky straight. I got the faded black, in the normal length I think (I'm 5'5'' but maybe longer legs than torso), and they fit well in my normal 27 (tight but will be perfect after stretching out a bit). I didn't size down. Most consistent with them and size 27. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - Buyer beware for ordering COH or AGOLDE cross-border as I have found their sizing drastically inconsistent lately, to the point that the jeans are not wearable (way too small to button or way to big and falling off waist) even in the same style and colour (exact same jean!). I still love COH and AGOLDE though I will likely aim to buy in store only now.

Gap,Yes definitely! There is a difference in fabric between wedgie straight and wedgie skinny's - with the straight's there might be a bit of a gap at the waist as they have less stretch (more of a traditional heavy cotton feel) but they are a really nice jean because they have a not too bulky button fly and look great styled with a belt so the gap doesn't matter as much as it would on a pair of skinny jeans. I have a pair myself and if anything I would advise against sizing up - they fit like any heavy denim jean once you break them in a bit so if you know your size stick with it.

Madewell,"Challenge Mode: AVAILABLE IN CANADA ^(without giving up your firstborn in import duties and taxes)

There is a problem I think many of us have (and that gets jerked a lot as well): many pants being sold are not made for smaller waists and bigger hips/butt/thighs. They either fit your waist and pull tightly across the thighs/hips (or maybe you couldn't even get them up over your thighs!), or they fit the lower half but are several sizes too big at the waist.

In case anyone isn't aware, many retailers, almost all of them only in the US *sob*, are offering ""curvy"" pants options, which are supposed to give you more room in the lower half while keeping the waist measurement accurate. There are also some pants models out there that are shaped like this but aren't labeled curvy.

I literally live in jeans. I wear them 5 days a week to work and if I'm doing something that requires pants on a weekend, I'll wear them too. I'm a software developer in a casual office so unless clients are visiting, there's no need to wear nicer pants.

**My Criteria + Guide for Looking**

* **Thick** denim. None of this jeggings, paper thin ""jeans"" stuff. I want it to not show my underwear through the fabric and I want it to last and be durable. Part of this involves:

- **High cotton percentage**. Start paying attention to what your jeans are made of. 1-2% of elastane is solid. 3-4% might be getting up there and I'd be worried about stretching out, but it depends on how they're made. Cotton ~85%+, minimal polyester (but some is definitely good to add durability and the ability to keep their shape). No lyocell for me - I had some higher-end jeans made out of lyocell that ripped very soon, but that may not always be the case. Higher cotton percent will also stretch out half a size or even a full size (98%-100% cotton a full size, less than that will stretch out half a size).

- **High rise**. 10"" minimum, preferably 11"". Anything lower and the muffin top happens. This may not be the case for you! Figure out how many inches are good for you and go for that.

- **Reasonable price**. Preferably maximum 150 CAD, not including taxes. If I can get it lower, great. But lower base prices usually mean they're not as thick and as durable as I would like. Having said that, don't be afraid of premium denim prices! Department stores put them on sale all the time (which is how I got some of mine), or eBay, or if you're in the US you can get them on Poshmark etc.

**TLDR;** [The Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eOjG-eAulPmanoTYi4jrkCI-WNF1UsGI8R084-R6sig/edit?usp=sharing) (with my measurements info at the top)

1st place: AGOLDE Roxanne in Freeway

2nd place: Madewell Curvy

3rd place: Citizens of Humanity Olivia (Premium Vintage line)

Please do comment below with any other brands or jeans you've had success with! Or even if you have a different experience than me with the jeans I've listed.

If you can't get any of these, try and buy:

- vintage (you get to see the jeans measurements up front)

- and/or jeans that fit your bottom half well tailored. I personally am way too lazy for this (I have a pile of pants I need to take to the tailor...) and I stubbornly wanted to have some that fit off the rack.

EDIT: Thanks very much for the gold and platinum, kind redditors. I'm glad this post seems to have helped some people!

Madewell,"I always struggled with pants shopping, like, I absolutely dreaded it - BUT THEN MADEWELL. They are all I buy now. I work in a production environment so I’m constantly stooping/crouching/leaning, AND I’ve been blessed with a large ass, so it’s a pretty big achievement when I can go for eight hours without feeling like I constantly have to pull them up, or feel like I want to rip them off because they keep cutting into my gut. I wore the same pair of jeans every single day for two weeks just for science and they did. not. quit. The stretch was still nice and tight and even after several dozen washes and a year later, my ass still felt like it was being cradled in angels wings. The only reason I have to eventually retire a pair is because my thigh rub eventually burns a hole. I don’t care if a NASA scientist developed a proprietary material for curvy chicks, after so many miles my thighs are going to damage some fabric.

Madewell,"Great idea for a post OP! I know this is a bit old but thought this might help someone to add my experience. 

Canadian currently living in USA - hoping this will help anyone thinking of ordering anything online - I know how annoying it is to find great denim in some places in Canada and missing out on sales that seem to only happen South of the border! 

My HG jeans are COH Liya in Sunday Morning which I got at Aritzia in Canada - size 27 (tight when bought, perfect now). I have never liked Levi's (didn't like the wedgie, i think it's called), wasn't huge on Madewell, most AGOLDE have not been great for me either (no room for thighs).  I almost exclusively wear non-stretch 97-100% cotton.  I also have the issue of too small for legs/hips and too big in the waist! 

Since moving to the US, I have tried on MANY COH and AGOLDE and also some Madewell and Everlane. Just a word of warning - sizing is all over the place for both COH and AGOLDE IMO. 

I tried on several COH OLIVIA pairs, including the 3rd place listed here which was honestly one of the best fitting pairs I have ever tried, but I didn't like the showing button fly (Olivia in Licorice, size 27, was perfect!) - but many many other Olivia in size 27 were so small I honestly would have needed a 29 to come close to buttons coming together. I have the Olivia Crop in 'Glance' (very very light blue) - which is not 'premium line' - size 27 is perfect. But the Olivia 'medium blue denim' ones from anthro were so small in 27, there was a 3-4inch gap between top buttons. I tried on what appeared to be the same Olivia ones in med blue ('circa' colour maybe?) at another store here in a 28, and they were much too big (needed 27). Tried on a few other ones at club monaco here, similar finding - one colour in 28 was too small (needed 29) another colour fit in the 27, both Olivia. I can't recall if those were 'premium' or not, but honestly they all had similar thickness and very little stretch. 

I also tried the Emery high rise in straight crop ('rose blue' I think, they were a medium blue). Tried them on at a store, perfect in 27 but didn't buy. Found on sale later online in same colour, ordered 27, and they were so big in the waist I think maybe I could have fit into a 25 (unheard of for me), but didn't re-order a 26 since I wasn't sure if it would fit like the pair I tried on in store... again sizing all over the place. 

I also had a similar experience with AGOLDE. I tried on and loved the Riley high rise straight crop (in 'SCENE') in a 27 and this one was probably the best fit I have ever had (room for bottom and fitted all the way around waist) - it seemed like they were custom made for me. But I didn't buy as I wanted to wait for sale - bought on sale from same store (mailed to me since store had no 27) and they were so small, no room for me below the waist, and so tiny at the waist the top button I could barely manage to get it shut. I sadly have to return and not sure if I want to re-order since I'm not sure if I should try for another 27, or a 28 or maybe 29 even...  

&#x200B;

Everlane - love the cheeky straight. I got the faded black, in the normal length I think (I'm 5'5'' but maybe longer legs than torso), and they fit well in my normal 27 (tight but will be perfect after stretching out a bit). I didn't size down. Most consistent with them and size 27. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - Buyer beware for ordering COH or AGOLDE cross-border as I have found their sizing drastically inconsistent lately, to the point that the jeans are not wearable (way too small to button or way to big and falling off waist) even in the same style and colour (exact same jean!). I still love COH and AGOLDE though I will likely aim to buy in store only now.

Madewell,"One of my other rules of thrift shopping is to keep hand sanitizer in the car. Even if I touch almost nothing, I always come out with “thrift store hands”, like they are covered in dust! We always bring gloves when we go to the Goodwill bins.

I have a lot of great stuff from Goodwill. Vintage stuff, merino wool and cashmere sweaters, unworn shoes (we’ve found some holy grails), silk tops, lots of business appropriate stuff like Banana Republic, J Crew, trendy expensive stuff like Madewell and Vince and J Peterman (I guess they aren’t that trendy). I have seen a lot with the tags still on, too!

I appreciate it when the brands that make outlet lines indicate it in some way on the tags, because I see a LOT of that stuff there, but the pricey stuff is mixed in. Another reason we go to Goodwill is that here, they get all the target clearance, which is great for decor and housewares. Our local Goodwills are very clean and pretty overpriced, but we have a lot of big ones nearby and they always have a tag color on sale, so they are a great first or last stop.",0.30469444444444443,0.5523333333333333,positive
Zara,"I have been thinking about this all week, because I feel *exactly* the same way.

I'm nearing 30 but still feel inclined to dress virtually the same way I did in high school and college: mid-rise skinny pants/jeans (full length, not ankle), blouses in black, white, navy or jewel tones, one-button blazers, and v-neck cardigans. The only prints I wear are geometric, and I like fitted to moderately fitted clothes; the current blousy, boxy silhouettes just don't look as good on me! Basically, a lot of the current trends (ankle pants, florals, ruffles, voluminous, boxy tops, high-rise pants, etc.) make me feel unattractive, so I decided to stick with what makes me personally feel good while trying to push my horizons a little.

Because I just started a new job last week teaching high school I felt like I really needed to update my wardrobe to something less dated. I also gained some weight recently, so I would have had to replaced everything anyways, so I figured it was the perfect time to try to update somewhat!

So, what I tried to do was to take my core style and push it a bit. I kept my pants and most of my sweaters well-fitted, but bought slightly boxier blouses and t-shirts. I don't care for most feminine touches, but I decided that I did like [lace](https://www.loft.com/lace-cap-sleeve-tee/473332?skuId=25533736&defaultColor=9000&catid=catl000011) and [bow/tie necklines](https://www.loft.com/pintucked-bow-flutter-shell/483911?skuId=25997323&defaultColor=4899&catid=catl000011), so I bought several blouses with each. I also bought lots of shirts with more visually interesting sleeve styles (puff sleeve, tie cuffs, tulip shape, etc.) in order to compensate for all the neutral, solid colors and otherwise plain-ish styling.

I also gave up on finding true geometric prints and settled with floral-ish prints but in [geometric layouts](https://www.loft.com/leaf-ruffle-collar-utility-blouse/476467)! And I compromised on the sweaters, buying two v-necks, one crew neck, and two long, open cardigans.

My wardrobe is now still basically my favorite silhouette, but with minor slightly more current details and compromises. I'm lucky that, as a teacher, I'm not expected to be trendy and my general preferences match up with what both students and admin expect educators to wear! I feel much more comfortable and happy at 50% ""current"" than I think I would if I tried to make myself dress 100% on-trend.

EDIT: Sorry for all the LOFT links. That's where I buy most of my sweaters and tops so it was just easier to find examples off the top of my head on their site!

As for how to keep up, I feel like just regular browsing through retail sites is what helps me the most. None of my friends are the least bit into fashion and I don't want to dress like my students, so that's the best way I've found to get fashion exposure.

I find it most useful, though, to regularly check the sites of brands I like like Ann Taylor, Loft, GAP, etc.

Zara,"I’m 37 and I do feel quite stylish! Well - at work I get a lot of outfit compliments from colleagues in their early 20s who themselves pretty stylish, so I feel that that is good evidence. But I don’t really adopt a lot of trends - like, I’ll go along with mega overall trends like shifts to wider legged pants and higher waists on most bottoms, and the emerging dominance of jumpsuits, but beyond that not really. But how do I keep up? Hard to say... I do notice what the women in their 20s around me are wearing and make mental notes of it. Also for my fast fashion purchases I tend to go to Zara, which I think usually strikes a good balance between trendy and classic. I think following a bunch of stylish women in Instagram would be a good start, that will keep you more or less current. Also you can window shop fast fashion stores, just to get a sense of what the current trends are.",0.23133333333333334,0.489,positive
Zara,"Ha! The ""shit from my teens/twenties is now being recycled as vintage"" problem is madly real. I have boxes of awesome jeans from the late 90s and early 2000's that I cannot bring myself to wear, even though they are technically returning --  because I am massively uber old, and I cannot rock a pair of Earnest Sewns. Even though they are lovely.

The old rule used to be that if you wore it when it was new you can't wear it when it comes back -- which is okay for some very trendy stuff but not for all of it. I think if you can damp down the 90s-ness you'll be fine.

But the larger problem is just that you do need to revamp yourself every few years, and particularly at major turning points: the problem with the move to adulthood is that it's not obviously marked. So you just dress the way you always have  until you wake up one day discovering that your sense of what is cute and funky and hip and cool is frozen in the year you turned 18, \*and you are no longer that person\*. The best result of this is that you look a little weird and dated. The worst is that you look delusional, like someone who's convinced that they're still 18 even though they are really 42.

Basically, the simple thing is to shop. Shop quite a bit. Try things on, see if you like stuff, let the sales people help you, look at the merchandizing; contemplate life. You don't have to BUY everything but you should try on lots of stuff, and you should try on stuff that you don't normally think of. And if you want to force the issue you can take all your stuff and stick it in a box while you go to Zara and other cheap places and buy yourself a new wardrobe.",0.12230744949494947,0.527503832972583,positive
H&M,"I turned 40 two days ago. Honestly I give zero fucks about what young trendy people think of my clothing choices. I know what looks good on me and what doesn’t. Occasionally something on-trend is a match for me, but more often than not I’ll buy 3 of the same knit tunic from H&M and boom that’s my fall wardrobe. Last year’s leggings, 2016’s Kate Spade scarves, a pair of Docs or Chucks... and that’s what you get from me.

I appreciate good style on other people. I think it’s cute that things I wore as a teenager are coming back for a THIRD time. But I’m busy living my life, which as you get older you realize is TOO SHORT to spend worrying about what is on trend this precise moment vs 5 minutes ago. 

I’m not tracking these things like I did when I was 20. And if I cared what women half my age thought of my wardrobe, I’d have to re-evaluate some shit. They live in my world, not the other way around. ",0.18506493506493507,0.43650793650793646,positive

* Target items: I only ever like the jeans at Universal Thread, the rest is too basic (A New Day) and too badly made (Wild Fable)
* Stop buying repeats - no more short sleeved button downs - just because it's in a different color/print doesn't make it different enough silhouette for me to feel excited when dressing
* Shoes that feel uncomfortable in the slightest way in the beginning will definitely get worse not better

I worked at Zara before for a period of two years. We never had a code for black shoppers specifically nor for anyone else. This article seems like it may just be an individual store. 

But to be honest my time at Zara was a bit of a free-for-all. The turn over rate was very high, management were kind of shady with some practices (scheduling hours just under 40, hour long unpaid breaks instead of the usual 15 and two 30s for an eight hour shift). Not a particularly great place to work. 

The worst thing was my manager wanted me to keep a security tag in my pocket and anyone who I thought suspicious I was supposed to approach the alarm to make it go off so it would seem like it was going off for them and then have cause to check their bag. I refused to do this, was threatened with a write-up but since I didn't cave she eventually dropped it.


Management at different stores varies widely, this may be specific to one where a culture got toxic because of a lot of thefts and generalizations. 

Many people stole I'm sure. But to be honest I did what I could but I was never comfortable acting like I was James Bond on the headset trying to catch someone taking a damn shirt (maybe that's why I'm pretty burnt out on the whole retail thing.)

Uniqlo,"the outerwear is all spectacular and i think much nicer quality than regular uniqlo outerwear.

i thought the sweaters were a bit thin, which was slightly disappointing.

all the cotton items are pretty standard uniqlo cotton (maybe slightly smoother) but the cuts were fun. the silk items felt nice, but not as nice as more expensive silks (obviously). the silk knit shirts were less soft than the bow blouse but i think that's just the nature of knit silks?

the wool items were all fab. i got trousers and the skirt and love them both.

also EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG? i know some of the items were supposed to be oversized but the sizing wasn't consistent. i was my usual size in skirt/pants and sweaters/shirts, but i had to size down in the oversized items because they were too big. the hybrid down coat which i got in a M (my usual uniqlo outerwear size) fit like a L or XL. the cotton shirtdress which i also got in a M (for non-outerwear i am usually between a s/m in uniqlo sizing because i am tall, and generally go with a M for sleeve length) fits like a L, but for that one i can make it work by styling it differently. if they had it in a S i would have gotten that instead, tho.

generally i am pleased with what i got. i think for the price it's not bad, and i like the cuts of the pieces and higher than usual fabric quality, although some pieces felt more worth it than others. 

i do NOT think it is worth buying at a markup tho. none of the pieces were particularly unique (except maybe some of the outerwear) and you would be able to find similar pieces from other places at a similar price point i think.",0.10388888888888888,0.45011752136752126,positive

I love the coats. The ULD is probably less exciting bc it’s pretty similar to the typical Uniqlo ULD’s but I like the way the hood is shaped, it frames the face in a unique way(?

In the past it used to have consistently higher quality, that in combination with their first designer collabs--attempts to shake off their frumpy image--made for a very brief period of pure magic lol.

Zara,"You are so right! 

The quality of clothing definitely declined in quality and every year it’s noticeable but if you know the fabrics you can make good choices. I used to throw away clothes because they got visibly bad but now I have only nice clothes that don’t get ruined. That is not good cause I have a limited space. 

My rules:
Sweaters without acrylic or a maximum 10% contents (ok 20% if I really love the design but this rarely happens) and a very low percentage of polyester (30% max)
T-shirts and hoodies only 100% cotton, no exceptions 
Everything else only viscose, linen, cotton, silk. I never buy fitted garments in polyester cause it wrinkles, makes you sweat and smelly (especially as a lining for a blazer, yuck). I do have like 2 beach flowy shirts that are 100% polyester. 
Shoes only leather (the inside should be too, I don’t buy if it’s not cause I made this mistake for a pair of Zara heeled slingback and they smell after I wore them few times) and cloth trainers from respectable brands. Also trainers with leather interior looks like new years after I buy them. 

These rules will leave you with very few options per year but it worths cause you look put together and crisp without spending a lot of money.

Follow this guide, wash you cloths accordingly, use a pilling bzzzz device to smooth sweaters if they get bad, always iron or steam your clothes before leaving house and you will look nice and tidy and people will appreciate you. Oh, and throw away T-shirts that don’t look as white/good as they used to when you bought them or have loose neck and stuff. A T-shirt stays perfect between 10-40 washes.

I live in PT too and Inditex stuff generally is better quality here than internationally, so if what they’re stocking here is deteriorating…  I still have pieces from Mango that are like 7-8 years old holding up amazingly and there is so very little of that quality in the stores now.

Also I forgot to mention, if you don’t have the possibility (or talent) to shop outerwear second hand as others suggested.

Coats in Mango are very good quality but you must buy those with a high percentage of wool. At least up to 40%. 
Or splurge in COS. Those last maaaany years. Mine has 7 and looks perfect. 
I even had one form Zara that looked good from 2011 to 2019. But they don’t make them as they used to :(

Always down puffer jackets. Looks better and keeps you warmer. 

Never buy a leather jacket in fake (ecological) leather. It’s better not have it in your wardrobe if you don’t afford real leather.

Everyone has sales twice a year when they change the seasonal collection. 

Mango mid December to late February and mid may to late August. 
Hennes and Mauritz (H&M, COS, & Other Stories) 
Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, OYSHO, pull and bear) January-February and June-September.

They start with prices cut for at least 10-20% and increase the cut price gradually throughout the sale period. 
An item is first cut 20%, then 20% more until it goes up to 80% off. But you will find in the end the clothes that are not very nice or extreme sizes. 
But you can still get treasures. I always do but I am committed and use their apps frequently to check stocks and prices, place online orders and also check their stores. Every store has different pieces as even in the same city people are different depending of the neighbourhood they live in. 

Mango used to be less popular than Zara and same quality, even if they had famous models like Kate Moss as their image for a seasonal collection. But now I feel that they kept their quality (Zara went downhill), their style is a little bit ahead of current time (they copy designs from other brands that Zara gets next collection) and their prices are somewhat just a slight bit higher than Zara.

H&M,"Across the board I see so many inconsistencies with quality that I find it hard to recommend stores or brands. Even Higher end brands have quality issues now. An example I’ve come across is a beautifully constructed blazer from H&M that was lined. I paid $39.99 for it. I also bought a blazer from Marc Jacob’s for $249 that wasn’t lined and started to lose its shape quickly. They were both a poly blend, but the H&M blazer was the clear winner. 

I was recently in a Micheal Kors store and was shocked to see a mini dress selling at $249 on sale that was a bad poly blend that could never be altered or tailored. If a tiny hole popped up near the hem, altering it would be noticeable. It’s the Wild Wild West out there!

Clotheshorse podcast has a great episode about the overall decline in quality. Definitely listen to that. She also talks about how expensive materials feel cheaper now because they use less cashmere, less silk etc. in the making of the garment. 

Then, I’d recommend going to different stores, even the ones you mention above, and look at the fabric content. Start from there. 

Because of clothing quality, I prefer to shop secondhand/vintage. I find the clothes pre 2008 (I know, not yet vintage) and earlier to be much better in quality and longevity. It took me about 2 years to really build a good wardrobe with pieces that worked for me and were interchangeable. Know your measurements and this is a great option! I also buy some pieces larger than my measurements because their material is easy to tailor. Never go just by size. You have no idea how someone treated their clothing even if they say it was never in the dryer or always dry cleaned. 

I still struggle with some items secondhand. I can’t find secondhand jeans that work on me (I do most of my hunting online). I love Madewell jeans. I also love some of the Levi’s jeans and will buy jeans from both of these brands new. 

I will probably never buy a non-vintage/pre-2008 coat again. I have found it so easy to find this type of item by resale. 

I love secondhand Equipment silk blouses. The silk is much more substantial and not as thin as the ones I see in store now. 

I like a lot of Banana republics silk cashmere tops. They work well for me in both workwear and weekend wear. I pair them with trousers and also over slip dresses. 

I find it hard to shop exclusively anymore with one brand or store. 

I hope some of this info about my experience is helpful for you as you go on this adventure. Excited for you that you’re able to invest in your wardrobe and find pieces that will work for you!!",0.148506370523416,0.4968836088154271,positive
H&M,"TBH I think it really depends on what you're buying from them, what you're looking for in terms of ""good quality"" (do you want to buy it for life? Is ""mid quality"" an indication of ""good quality"" to you or do you demand ""high quality""?) and what your definition of 'low end' vs 'high end' is -- I'm guessing you're going to get really inconsistent answers depending on personal definition of each of these. For example, my 'mid-range' is likely to be far cheaper than some people's and still far more expensive than another group of people's. 

&#x200B;

For reference: I would consider A&F regular price to be mid to high-mid at minimum for example. As well, as another example, I'd say that H&M's quality varies wildly from piece to piece and that not all of their pieces (let alone prices) are 'low-end'.

&#x200B;

That being said, I'd say in terms of personal perception for stuff I have personal experience with:

\- Someone already covered the Old Navy/Gap/Banana Republic low/mid/high divide, but I think Gap can be a bit overpriced when it comes to quality depending on the item.

\- Ambercrombie has honestly improved quite a bit from 10-15 years ago from what I remember of them. They have some genuinely nice wool items like coats and sweaters. I've also heard good things about their jeans/dresses. I'd say very much worth a look, especially on sale.

\- Calvin Klein has some solid, basic dresses in classic shapes I've seen on sale at Nordstrom Rack before. Definitely worth a look if that's what you're in the market for and when it's at those prices, but I doubt at 'full price' whatever that might be would be worth it.

\- Uniqlo has very solid basics at an affordable price, especially if you stick to the stuff that they always sell. Their fit is very specific though so definitely try it in a store first if you are concerned about fit on t-shirts in particular. Heattech is an absolute godsend and is something I'd recommend even at full price.

&#x200B;

For the stores: Kohl's is low to mid-range on price and the style is very hit or miss with quality to match. Macy's/JCPenny's can be on the low-end of price with regards to sales but quality can vary from low to mid-range or high-mid depending on brand. There's some very solid brands being sold at Macy's and JC Penny's but you need to be looking at them by brand rather than just generally at the store.

Uniqlo,"So, the issue is that the companies that sell affordable quality clothing also sell stuff that falls apart.

The companies that are **consistently** good quality charge more because that is what you're paying for (the consistency).

It is possible to find quality clothing at any of the
 stores you listed, but it means putting in the leg work and actually shopping in store and looking at each piece physically before you buy it.  Either that, or going second hand, is really the only way you'll get quality without the matching price tag.

That said, I have had very good luck with Abercrombie jeans.  If you're in Canada, Simons house brands as well.  I have no luck with uniqlo because their clothes aren't made for my body (hourglass) but lots of other people I know like them.",0.21849999999999997,0.4697857142857143,positive
Uniqlo,"I'd consider Old Navy low end but I'm sure, like anywhere, you might be able to find something that works when you go into the actual store. Abercrombie seems like mid low-end/kids clothing to me (this is possibly because I grew up lusting after A&F clothes only realize in adulthood how cheap looking they actually were - I know people seem to like them now but every time I look at their site I'm like mehhhh my money is better spent elsewhere). I'd also consider Express lower mid-range and avoid them because the quality is just not there.

I have a few GAP & Banana Republic pieces that have stood the test of time but I haven't purchased from them in awhile. I'd consider them mid-range. I've never bought anything MK because it's not my style (also they seem logo heavy to me?). Calvin Klein seems to be good for basics - have a pair of nude pumps that are classic & go with everything.

Uniqlo is also lower mid-range. I'm a fan of their basic tees and have a few fluffy jackets that I use as loungewear. They're definitely fast fashion so I try to buy sparingly.

I would not shop at Macy's, JCPenney or Kohl's as they all feel like TJ Maxx masquerading as a full price department store. However, I would still shop at TJ Maxx.

Department stores: Nordstrom, Bloomingdales.

Mid-range, mostly consistent: Madewell (not the cotton t-shirts, they're gonna get hole-y QUICK), J. Crew (have found solid bathing suits/coats), MANGO (this is low mid-range but I've had some luck), Reformation (especially good if you can find it second hand/on sale), OpenEdit (Nordstrom brand), & Other Stories (have second hand jeans that seem to be doing well).

You also have to consider your own style - what're you going for/what do you need? Trendier clothing is typically going to be lower quality IMO (as are trendier shoes).

A fashion friend taught me to pay attention to fabric content/seams. Natural fibers look best and will hold up better. Also shoes! Buy some nice quality shoes (sneakers, sandals, whatever you need for your day to day life).",0.19238095238095232,0.42515873015873024,positive
Uniqlo,"TBH I think it really depends on what you're buying from them, what you're looking for in terms of ""good quality"" (do you want to buy it for life? Is ""mid quality"" an indication of ""good quality"" to you or do you demand ""high quality""?) and what your definition of 'low end' vs 'high end' is -- I'm guessing you're going to get really inconsistent answers depending on personal definition of each of these. For example, my 'mid-range' is likely to be far cheaper than some people's and still far more expensive than another group of people's. 

&#x200B;

For reference: I would consider A&F regular price to be mid to high-mid at minimum for example. As well, as another example, I'd say that H&M's quality varies wildly from piece to piece and that not all of their pieces (let alone prices) are 'low-end'.

&#x200B;

That being said, I'd say in terms of personal perception for stuff I have personal experience with:

\- Someone already covered the Old Navy/Gap/Banana Republic low/mid/high divide, but I think Gap can be a bit overpriced when it comes to quality depending on the item.

\- Ambercrombie has honestly improved quite a bit from 10-15 years ago from what I remember of them. They have some genuinely nice wool items like coats and sweaters. I've also heard good things about their jeans/dresses. I'd say very much worth a look, especially on sale.

\- Calvin Klein has some solid, basic dresses in classic shapes I've seen on sale at Nordstrom Rack before. Definitely worth a look if that's what you're in the market for and when it's at those prices, but I doubt at 'full price' whatever that might be would be worth it.

\- Uniqlo has very solid basics at an affordable price, especially if you stick to the stuff that they always sell. Their fit is very specific though so definitely try it in a store first if you are concerned about fit on t-shirts in particular. Heattech is an absolute godsend and is something I'd recommend even at full price.

&#x200B;

For the stores: Kohl's is low to mid-range on price and the style is very hit or miss with quality to match. Macy's/JCPenny's can be on the low-end of price with regards to sales but quality can vary from low to mid-range or high-mid depending on brand. There's some very solid brands being sold at Macy's and JC Penny's but you need to be looking at them by brand rather than just generally at the store.

In the past it used to have consistently higher quality, that in combination with their first designer collabs--attempts to shake off their frumpy image--made for a very brief period of pure magic lol. I have a pair of wool culottes from the very first Lemaire collab in 2015, they still feel like a holy grail find. My husband has some old (10+ years ago) Uniqlo men's button down shirts, with their old logo tag, and they are still perfectly wearable, nice sturdy fabric and finished french seams inside. Nothing like that there anymore, and even the designer collab items, which I take a peep at every year, aren't that different from their usual stock, quality-wise, these days.

But I still think current Uniqlo is perfectly fine for a few basic items (socks, heattech if you wear it, the Uniqlo U crewneck tee), and like a lot of fast fashion brands OP mentions, they also offer 100% cotton denim, which is hard to mess up and can be quite good if the fit suits you.",0.14500260541927212,0.48731762065095396,positive

They definitely have more trendy items these days, but I feel like Uniqlo has a lot of items that are dependable and have been good staples in my wardrobe: some of their graphic tees (quality is VERY variable), airism line, heattech, packable puffer, loungewear, etc. I just recently decided to retire one of my Uniqlo jeggings that survived from 2017, which I feel like was long enough.

Gap,"Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic are literally the same company -- Old Navy is its lowest end, Gap is its mid range, and Banana Republic is its version of high end. As you go up the scale, the clothing tends to get higher-quality (at least in terms of materials) and trendier.",0.01,0.24416666666666664,neutral
Gap,"You need to look at the individual pieces. A wool sweater from Banana Republic and an acrylic sweater from Banana Republic are two entirely different garments. 

You need to look at construction, fiber, and fit.

Construction: how do the seams look? Do the stripes match up? Are the grainlines straight? Is it cut on the bias or not? What does the inside of the garment look like? Are the seams finished? Does the lining look like it’s supposed to? 

Fiber: Prioritize natural fibers, but understand that certain synthetics are used deliberately. For example, a wool sweater with some nylon is going to be your BFF way more than an acrylic blend.  Look at the percentages of fiber in the garment and understand the reason why you might see a specific blend, and know how those fibers wear. 

Fit: You can have the most beautifully made, couture level construction with natural materials and if the fit sucks, you’re out of luck.  Fit can be impacted by construction (grainlines, seams, etc), but it’s mostly impacted by the way the clothing pieces are designed and fitted together.  Even though Old Navy, Gap, and BR are the same company, their fit models are VERY different, with Banana Republic designing clothes for slimmer, long-waisted women with narrower hips compared to Gap, and with Old Navy using more elastic and stretch to accommodate a wide range of bodies in fewer sizes (S, M, L) instead of using techniques that create better fit but require more sizes to be designed and produced (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12).  Sometimes that is a GREAT choice, like with basic tees and athletic wear that is already stretchy. Sometimes it results in dresses that rely on ruching/elastic for bodice fit.

Walmart often has 100% cotton dresses for sale during the summer that are gorgeous, but they look best if you steam them before wearing because poplin can be a real asshole fabric in terms of wrinkles. Are they beautifully lined with bias trim seam finishes and hand-stitched hems? No. Will I 100% buy them over a poly-blend thing at Nordstrom? YES, because I know that a cotton sundress is going to be an overall better garment for my needs. 

Old Navy linen blend pants are my favorite thing ever. They are lovely. They hold up so well it’s stupid. They last longer than the ones I got from J. Crew, which lasted a season until they got absolutely shredded in the crotch/thigh. 

Down vests are awesome until you get wet or wear them on the water, since they’re actually dangerous if you capsize — they get HEAVY! A nice little poly-fill will work just as well.  Cotton is the same.  If you go for a hike wearing a cotton tee and a down vest, end up getting stuck in the rain, you will be cold and miserable. If you wear a wool or synthetic athletic tee and a wool or poly-fill outer layer, you will be fine. It’s why outdoor stores sell thick cotton-blend sweaters as “apres” clothing, it’s the stuff you put on after you do your thing outside in the cold. 

Rayon/viscose challis is great for hot climates, but not when the hot climate is humid. Then it will feel kind of clingy and gross. It’s why you see cotton sundresses in New England and Florida, but beautiful viscose caftans in Palm Springs. Palm Springs is hot but it’s the desert.

It needs to be by garment. By individual garment, for your needs, in your climate, on your body.

Another example: My wedding gown’s outer layer ie the thing you see? It was polyester satin, as are most wedding gowns in the US. I went with a matte satin. It was gorgeous, fit like a glove, was beautifully constructed, had immaculate boning, cotton lining, horsehair interfacing in the skirt seam, and all of the couture finishes.  It would have been an absolute waste to sew that thing up in real silk, since it will only be worn a handful of times and I was not about to drop $15K on a dress.  I paid more for a beautifully constructed dress (boning in the bodice/bust instead of bra pads), which is what I prioritized.  

It’s like a diamond. Fiber, Fit, Function, Construction are like Carat, Clarity, Cut, and Color.  Do you want big and flashy but don’t care about how cloudy it is? Great, prioritize that! 
Do you want the sparkliest, most clear, white diamond ever but it’s fine if it’s smaller? Don’t prioritize carats.  Do you want everything? Be super rich.

Do you want ethically made, couture construction with natural fibers perfectly tailored to you for every single outfit? Great, be rich. If not, figure out where your priorities are, where your budget is, and what look you’re going for!",0.23848941668235143,0.5417359150511324,positive
Gap,"Personally, I've been trying to consider more about clothing material and not just the store I'm buying that clothing at. You can be sold a 100% polyester or acrylic shirt at Target, Walmart, Saks, Banana Republic, Zara etc etc. They're all going to do what polyester does -- get weird. 
Now, I look for at LEAST 50% natural materials (cotton, wool, linen). I'm not at a place financially where I can only buy pima cotton or anything, but I have been finding that the pieces I buy feel higher quality for longer. 
Is a 100% cotton shirt or sweater from BP going to last longer or hold up better than one from Gap or ON? Probably/maybe. But they're all going to hold up better than the acrylic one I could buy anywhere.

I have a few GAP & Banana Republic pieces that have stood the test of time but I haven't purchased from them in awhile. I'd consider them mid-range. I've never bought anything MK because it's not my style (also they seem logo heavy to me?). Calvin Klein seems to be good for basics - have a pair of nude pumps that are classic & go with everything.

Uniqlo is also lower mid-range. I'm a fan of their basic tees and have a few fluffy jackets that I use as loungewear. They're definitely fast fashion so I try to buy sparingly.

I would not shop at Macy's, JCPenney or Kohl's as they all feel like TJ Maxx masquerading as a full price department store. However, I would still shop at TJ Maxx.

You also have to consider your own style - what're you going for/what do you need? Trendier clothing is typically going to be lower quality IMO (as are trendier shoes).

Thin as shit knitwear, awful denim, basics are mostly plastic-y feeling synthetics. I live in PT too and Inditex stuff generally is better quality here than internationally, so if what they’re stocking here is deteriorating…  I still have pieces from Mango that are like 7-8 years old holding up amazingly and there is so very little of that quality in the stores now. 

Although none of that is true for menswear, it is MUCH better than the womenswear.

Also I forgot to mention, if you don’t have the possibility (or talent) to shop outerwear second hand as others suggested.

Coats in Mango are very good quality but you must buy those with a high percentage of wool. At least up to 40%. 
Or splurge in COS. Those last maaaany years. Mine has 7 and looks perfect. 
I even had one form Zara that looked good from 2011 to 2019. But they don’t make them as they used to :(

Always down puffer jackets. Looks better and keeps you warmer. 

Never buy a leather jacket in fake (ecological) leather. It’s better not have it in your wardrobe if you don’t afford real leather.

Everyone has sales twice a year when they change the seasonal collection. 

Mango mid December to late February and mid may to late August. 
Hennes and Mauritz (H&M, COS, & Other Stories) 
Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, OYSHO, pull and bear) January-February and June-September.

They start with prices cut for at least 10-20% and increase the cut price gradually throughout the sale period. 
An item is first cut 20%, then 20% more until it goes up to 80% off. But you will find in the end the clothes that are not very nice or extreme sizes. 
But you can still get treasures. I always do but I am committed and use their apps frequently to check stocks and prices, place online orders and also check their stores. Every store has different pieces as even in the same city people are different depending of the neighbourhood they live in. 

Mango used to be less popular than Zara and same quality, even if they had famous models like Kate Moss as their image for a seasonal collection. But now I feel that they kept their quality (Zara went downhill), their style is a little bit ahead of current time (they copy designs from other brands that Zara gets next collection) and their prices are somewhat just a slight bit higher than Zara. Their stocks are better than Zara and that’s why you can find nice clothes at 40% off.",0.05221337304670638,0.45318138651471984,neutral
Madewell,"Across the board I see so many inconsistencies with quality that I find it hard to recommend stores or brands. Even Higher end brands have quality issues now. An example I’ve come across is a beautifully constructed blazer from H&M that was lined. I paid $39.99 for it. I also bought a blazer from Marc Jacob’s for $249 that wasn’t lined and started to lose its shape quickly. They were both a poly blend, but the H&M blazer was the clear winner. 

I was recently in a Micheal Kors store and was shocked to see a mini dress selling at $249 on sale that was a bad poly blend that could never be altered or tailored. If a tiny hole popped up near the hem, altering it would be noticeable. It’s the Wild Wild West out there!

Clotheshorse podcast has a great episode about the overall decline in quality. Definitely listen to that. She also talks about how expensive materials feel cheaper now because they use less cashmere, less silk etc. in the making of the garment. 

Then, I’d recommend going to different stores, even the ones you mention above, and look at the fabric content. Start from there. 

Because of clothing quality, I prefer to shop secondhand/vintage. I find the clothes pre 2008 (I know, not yet vintage) and earlier to be much better in quality and longevity. It took me about 2 years to really build a good wardrobe with pieces that worked for me and were interchangeable. Know your measurements and this is a great option! I also buy some pieces larger than my measurements because their material is easy to tailor. Never go just by size. You have no idea how someone treated their clothing even if they say it was never in the dryer or always dry cleaned. 

I still struggle with some items secondhand. I can’t find secondhand jeans that work on me (I do most of my hunting online). I love Madewell jeans. I also love some of the Levi’s jeans and will buy jeans from both of these brands new. 

I will probably never buy a non-vintage/pre-2008 coat again. I have found it so easy to find this type of item by resale. 

I love secondhand Equipment silk blouses. The silk is much more substantial and not as thin as the ones I see in store now. 

I like a lot of Banana republics silk cashmere tops. They work well for me in both workwear and weekend wear. I pair them with trousers and also over slip dresses. 

I find it hard to shop exclusively anymore with one brand or store. 

I hope some of this info about my experience is helpful for you as you go on this adventure. Excited for you that you’re able to invest in your wardrobe and find pieces that will work for you!!",0.148506370523416,0.4968836088154271,positive

Madewell,"I know you may be intimidated by this, but if you're willing to increase your budget by just a smidge, I highly reccomend shopping for pre-owned designer clothing on sites like Poshmark, Depop, TRR, and ThreadUp. I've seen a Miu Miu cropped button-down shirt for 50$. I'm currently eyeing a Vivienne Westwood top for 55$. I recently purchased a Comme de Garcon top for 28$. If you're willing to drop 60$ on a fast-fashion Banana Republic shirt, you can mostly definitely find the designer equivalent for a similar or maybe even slightly higher price online.

Nowadays, I prefer designer clothing because even mid-tier brands such as Madewell and BR are often pressured by consultants to cut costs and increase prices. Designer brands can also experience quality issues (see: Chanel bags), but for the most part, they are not beholden to the same market powers as their retail counterparts. Both rich and poor people myself expect the creme de la creme when investing in designer pieces. Additionally, designer clothes are a bang for your buck because the construction is nicer, the designs are much more intentional, and the quality of fabric and materials is super high. My style and ability to curate new outfits improved immensely when I dipped my toes in the oh-so intimidating world of designer fashion.

It's up to you whether you want to shop at BR or Macy's, but I can tell you that everytime I enter these stores, there's maybe one or two pieces I love out of a sea fast-fashion quality items. That being said, don't feel pressured to buy designer everything.

Madewell,"I’ve been doing a lot of thrifting lately, looking for natural fibers and stuff that holds up well- as in, looks nice even secondhand. 

J Crew and Lands End always get a second look from me and are pretty consistently natural fibers. I’ve been really happy with all the items I’ve thrifted from those brands, they hold up well over time, are comfortable, and look very classy when styled.

St John’s Bay, J.Jill, and Madewell are often natural fibers, but not always. Pieces that are obviously newer look nice, but I’ve come across a few that did not hold up over time. Madewell’s shirts are cute but their pants look atrocious on me haha. I never buy Madewell jeans because they’re always about 6 inches too short-but that’s just me and doesn’t really speak to the quality. SJB I’ve never really thought of as high end, but I’m finding some really nice natural fiber cardigans and sweaters from them lately. J.Jill is really hit or miss, I’ve found some excellent Pima cotton tops, and a couple of cashmere cardigans (that admittedly did not hold up for very long compared to the other cashmere I have). But I’ve also found a lot of polyester and rayon in their brand, too. 

Banana republic and Michael Kors are brands that really align with my style, but honestly, way more than half the clothes I find from these brands are synthetic, and by the time they get to the thrift store are pilly, stretched out, or faded. I’ve been really disappointed with the Banana pieces that I’m finding lately, I had always kind of considered them a high-end brand in my mind but the synthetic fabrics that wear out terribly feel very fast fashion to me.

Madewell,"Madewell's fall 2014 lookbook—beautiful uses of denim, flannel, and texturally rich knits",0.375,0.75,positive
Madewell,"Madewell is one of my favorite women's brands—their pieces often feel fashionably relevant but still familiar and easy-to-style for many people, in many different ways. They recently released their lookbook for fall 2015, and I'm curious what FFA makes of it! 

**[Here's an album of all 25 looks.](http://imgur.com/a/1EkzX)** I added some of my own thoughts and commentary to each! Some general thoughts/themes I noticed:

* subverting classic Americana/workwear things like denim and flannel
* lots of mixed patterns at varying scales
* a good deal of elongated silhouettes (longer tops that slouch down)
* some very lush knits and interesting textures
* 70s-influenced pieces like flares
* a good range of pieces that are sporty/preppy/schoolmarm-y/cutesy

There's a brief *[Fashionista](http://fashionista.com/2015/04/madewell-fall-2015-lookbook)* article that discusses Madewell's inspiration for the collection:

> For next season, Madewell’s head of design Somsack Sikhounmuong explained that his team started with elements that are traditionally associated with fall — plaid, shearling, “changing leaf” colors and military-inspired pieces — and switched up their context a little bit. For example, multiple plaids are styled together for an eye-catching outfit that might initially seem a little crazy, and Madewell’s now-famous denim is used in completely new ways, like to create a parka or a boiler suit. Overalls are back, but with a retro, flared leg; a classic French mariner tee is cut as an easy dress; a polished, menswear-inspired coat is paired with a casual, destroyed jean and head-to-toe sweater dressing (with a matching top, pant, coat and scarf) is highly encouraged. “It’s sort of insane, but in a good way,” Sikhounmuong said “But you can definitely pull the pieces apart and wear them on their own just as easily.”

—

Madewell is also a fascinating brand to me—when I first started posting on FFA, in 2010 *(help, I'm old now)* J. Crew was the most relevant/defining brand for a lot of FFAers, and WAYWTs were full of J. Crew pieces. This has also been reflected on a larger scale, as well—[Madewell's expanded rapidly as J. Crew has declined in popularity and sales](http://fashionista.com/2015/02/madewell-nordstrom-net-a-porter). There's also an interesting _New York Times_ article on the CEO of J. Crew (which owns Madewell) and [his goals for Madewell](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/fashion/at-madewell-mickey-drexlers-third-act.html):

Madewell,"I love the Madewell aesthetic, and while the pictures here are over styled, I think they'd look good if you removed some layers, or just skipped the really ridiculous pieces (midi tight denim skirt, I'm looking at you).

But whenever I look at and try on Madewell clothing these days, my biggest criticism is that it could just be better fitting. Sezane pulls off a comparable aesthetic (the closest I've found) without all the boxy cut tops with drop shoulders, and without a million layers, ridiculous pieces nobody would wear (flare overalls), etc. Both are at silly price points, but I'd actually consider Sezane's pieces a little more seriously, despite the prices. I know Madewell is trendier and aims for a more relaxed look. I always try clothes on there and think it should be cut differently but I'm not taking it to a tailor to completely change the silhouette either.

Madewell,"I stumbled into a Madewell last year looking for a chunky knit pullover sweater. Nothing in the store looked *classic* enough for my tastes; it was all just slightly ""off"" in the details: rounded hems rather than straight, weird zig-zaggy knit patterns rather than cables, etc. BUT I tried stuff on, and was impressed with the quality and how well things fit on me. So often things look great on the hanger and then terrible on my body, so it was a pleasant surprise that it was the other way around in Madewell's clothes. I tried on a flannel that was so soft and warm and perfectly fitting that I didn't want to take it off. In fact, I ended up buying it at full-price (and ended up wearing the shit out of it this f/w, to the point where the cost-per-wear was less than my cheaper LL Bean flannels) as well as the not-very-classic aran-influenced cropped ivory sweater, which happened to be on sale.

I have noticed their denim cuts and some of the tops are veering into *too* trendy and a little too experimental, though. I hope they don't go down the same road as J. Crew with quality issues and bizarre, unwearable looks. But if the quality stays high and things continue to flatter me, well, I guess let's just say it's a good thing that few things appeal to me just by looking at them on-line.

I like the emerald dress and knee high books in 20. And the 'classic madewell' look. But most of those just look shabbily unflattering to me.

My grandma calls capri-esque calf-cut short pants - like in the first picture - Toulouse Lautrecs.",0.28138888888888886,0.5075,positive
Madewell,"I like #13 and #4 isn't terrible (much prefer a darker denim), but otherwise...I'm just not a fan. I want to hold all of these models down and brush their hair and make them look like they haven't been sick or dead for three days. This style just looks really sloppy to me--I see mentions in here about the styling being off, so maybe some of these pieces would look better done differently. 

The brand itself is owned by j.crew anyway, but they also more or less [use a company history that doesn't belong to them and isn't even relevant](http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannosowitz/how-madewell-bought-and-sold-my-familys-history#.ceQ22GKN76).",-0.14531746031746032,0.5162698412698412,negative

Madewell,"Have you bought Sézane stuff? I've been very curious about trying out the brand. I do agree with you about the silhouettes, though—there was one season where almost _every_ Madewell top was a slouchy, drop-shoulder kind of thing, and it was sometimes frustrating.

Madewell,"I think Madewell is deliberately trying to shy away from being classic—where J. Crew is proud of classic, prototypical cardigan that they carry every season and have for years, I think Madewell is more invested in being youthful and experimental. It's interesting now that J. Crew has their J. Crew Collection line and is a bit more invested in being fashionable—they're taking J. Crew far away from what its fans love, but the people who are going to buy, say, [Public School](http://www.style.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/public-school), aren't the kinds of people that regularly shop at J. Crew.

Madewell,"I haven't, and I want to SO bad but I cannot, for the life of me, pull the trigger on $90+ for a shirt. I would wear every single thing in their line though, and haven't found a single item that's a total miss when looking at their lookbook.
It's just absolutely perfectly my taste in clothes, and pretty close in even shoes and purses (although Madewell gets closer there with their leather satchels and oxfords). If I could, I would own the tomboy shirt in every color and print. It looks perfect.

I think even in the most recent seasons, Madewell silhouettes and cuts have been really off, but I'm holding out for it getting better as trends slowly change. And yes, there is really good cohesiveness across an entire season so I feel like if we hit a season where their clothes fit more normally again, then I'm going to want the entire store!",0.24511278195488728,0.5839598997493735,positive
Madewell,"What's funny to me is that I love J. Crew's classic looks, and then they end up looking frumpy on me (probably due to vanity sizing), whereas the Madewell stuff looks a little too trendy to me, but then I put it on and it *feels* classic, and fits me better. It would be interesting to see what kind of sizing models they each use. Lots of reviews on-line of Madewell's stuff (l-sleeve shirts, jeans) complain that they are not good for taller, long-limbed women, but for short ol' me, they fit great!",0.287202380952381,0.5470238095238096,positive
Madewell,"Idk about the taller long-limbed thing! I've heard that complaint before, but I fit that description and love Madewell's sweaters.

I like the aesthetic of the collection but wasn't planning on buying anything, partly due to being somewhat put off by some of the bad PR H&M has been getting recently, partly due to the items I like not being suited for my lifestyle. The one piece I liked enough that I could consider buying it, [the long floral gown](https://www.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/12/erdemhm26.jpg) turned out to be pretty much all synthetic, and even if the aforementioned issues had not been at hand, I would not pay 280 dollars for a poly-dress.

But I did buy some pieces for my gf and me if you want to have a look:

Blouse https://imgur.com/a/J8smb

This is what impressed me the most quality wise, I mean at 100€ it's not cheap but the finish is pretty spot on and you can really see the attention to detail.

Red pullover https://imgur.com/a/z1mMq
Also very nice quality, soft wool and the colour is a gorgeous deep wine red.

I also got her the floral tights, which most likely will be returned because they feel flimsy (duh they're tights ...) and the colours are kinda disappointing https://imgur.com/a/GIOuk

If you are interested in the male collection here is what I bought for myself: The blue pullover, which I almost wanted to return because of the high synthetic proportion and how itchy it is compared to the red ladies pullover, but I'll probably keep it because of the awesome colour. The blue pants with turquois check pattern, which I will definitely return because it barely fit's around my bubblebutt (also the quality is very ""meh""). And also the red cuban-collar shirt which I will definitely keep because it has a this amazing pattern to it and makes me feel like I belong in Narcos (Although everybody I asked seems to hate it because it's too ""out there"" ... still keeping it). https://imgur.com/a/nHQGi

All in all I really liked the aesthetic of this collection and it is pretty wearable, still me and my gf went for the more basic pieces and shied away from the bigger statement options. This has also to do with the rather high price point, it's way more investment-level then regular H&M prices.

Gap,"Levi’s used to have “curvy” cuts that were specifically labeled that way, as did Lee. I know because I had a bunch of pairs of both and they lasted forever, so I have no idea when they discontinued them, but I believe that they did because I can no longer find any.  The best pair of Levi’s that I’ve tried so far are Levi’s 725, Style #18759, which are a high waisted bootcut. I have one pair and I’m going to get another. Even though they are not a true curvy cut, they have less of a gap at the waist than most other pairs that I’ve tried on recently, and they’re less likely to fall down when I’m walking, which is why I’m going to get another pair for now, even though they’re not perfect. I’m still looking for a true “curvy” cut, which is what brought me to this post.

Gap,Which brands work for you? We have a similar gap,0.0,0.4,neutral
Gap,"Hi! I just follow the size chart on their website, so I'm a size 28. Actually, their jeans chart size is adjusted for their curvy collection (they are showing a 15 inch difference whereas 10 inch difference in their normal collection, which is also the standard for jeans). By the way, I'm not sure I would recommend Everlane's jeans to someone who has more than a 13 inch difference. 

I'd say for me, the [Curvy Way High Jeans](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-curvy-way-high-jean-vintage-indigo?collection=womens-curvy-jeans) is a miracle, it fits almost perfectly (there is maybe a very slight waist gap at the back, in that it is not extremely tight -- as Jeans should be). I will buy more of these, since they fit me like a dream.

One month ago, when I wrote this comment, I ordered the [Original Curvy Cheeky Jeans](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-curvy-cheeky-jean-washed-midnight?collection=womens-curvy-jeans) which are still 70% off for some reason, so I am wondering if they're just letting that style go. It is definitely a bit tight in the bum/hips area (the fabric is pulling and gathering in the groin area) and I feel like the waist gap is slightly bigger than my Way High Jeans.  These downsides are nowhere near as bad as the Abercrombie, for example, so I will still wear it, but it was a bit of a let down from the amazing Way High Jeans.",0.12243145743145747,0.47511544011544016,positive

Madewell,"*** one year later update at the end!***
After years of trying to find pants that fit, I present to you my findings. 

**My criteria**: no jeggings. I need jeans that I can wear into my office or out on a date that won’t stretch out. It gets cold in the winter so I like jeans with some substance. I like classic cuts and lean away from trendy colors that go out of style quickly. Price is a factor but I’ve spent so much on jeans the last 5 years that at this point I'm willing to spend if they fit perfectly.  
**My measurements**: 5’9, \~150lbs, waist 28”, hips 42”  
I do a decent amount weightlifting so I have larger thighs and hips and a smaller waist- jeans are chronically gapping at my waist and tight on hips.  
***Here’s what I found****:*  
**First place: Unspun** ( use a body scan on your phone and they make a custom pattern for you)  
\- Price: \~$150 after first pair discount  
\- Fit: available in skinny, straight, and baggy fits across rises  
\- Overall: Fit like a dream, beautiful high quality denim, with timeless fits (read: no tears, weird colors, or unflattering cuts). More expensive but absolutely worth it, and takes the guess-work out of online shopping. Also committed to reducing carbon footprints and reduces fashion waste which is a plus.

  
**Second place: Abercrombie** curve love:  
\- Price: $90-110  
\- Fit: available boot cut and loose fit  
\- Overall: Decent jeans, nothing to call home about. Mostly trendy cuts, and they often install a slanted zipper rather than actually adjusting the pattern for curvy fits, which looks super weird with a belt. They hold their shape, but I probably wouldn’t wear to work. Don't love the fast fashion aspect.

  
**Third place:** Getting normal cut jeans tailored (annoying, i know)  
\- Price: I bought a pair of standard cut madewell’s at the thrift store for $15 and paid $45 at a local tailor to get the waist taken in. All in around $60.  
\- Fit: perfect!   
\- Overall: If you can find high quality jeans secondhand that fit your hips and inseam, this is a great way to go, and surprisingly affordable. Just time consuming and not replicable but better than fast fashion.

  
**Other brands:**  
**American Eagle Curvy:**  
\- Price: $50-60  
\- Fit: only come in baggy/ mom jean fits. Jeans have a high % elastic and stretch 1-2 sizes after wear.  
\- Overall:  Sizing is super inconsistent and jeans stretch out quickly. I also don’t find the cuts flattering and they don’t offer any slim/ professional cuts. I had to return several pairs that were branded the same size but were completely different cuts. The pairs I own are a size 4 and 8, and the fit is the same.  
**Good American**  
\- Price: $150  
\- Fit: variety of cuts and colors  
\- Overall: Felt like jeggings to me and stretched out a ton. Not worth the money. They fit a curvy cut because they’re super stretchy, but the fabric felt iexpensive and I didn’t like how the waistband looked like my leggings. Not something I’d wear to work and kind of feels like a kardashian cash grab.

  
**FITJEANS**  
\- price: $120/ pair  
\- Fit: come in skinny, bootcut, and baggy cuts  
\- Overall:  overpriced jeggings. Both of my pairs wore out really quickly and didn’t look like actual jeans. If they were $40, they’d be great, but for me the quality just isn’t there.  


*** one year later update ***

**madewell**
I’m not sure why I didn’t try madewell curvy earlier, but they are AMAZING. I now have four pairs and it’s basically all I wear. New pairs are in the $120 range but I’ve found some great deals on Poshmark. Their curvy line isn’t quite as extensive as their regular fit but it’s still pretty broad.

**unspun**
I love the idea of custom made + low carbon impact pants, but these did NOT age well. Lots of minor fit issues started to show up. Ended up giving away my pair. My hubby also got a pair that had some weird fit problems.

H&M,"Yep. What's the point of this post? I'm not entirely sure. I think maybe so that others planning capsule wardrobes can learn from my mistakes. Maybe also to contribute another average person's experience with the highly coveted and glamorously minimalistic travel capsule wardrobe. I love the idea, but in practice I made a few critical errors.

My friends and I went to Seoul, Korea and Tokyo, Japan for a week each in May. My boyfriend and I were determined to not check luggage and because of flight baggage restrictions (which we learned later are completely lax for some airlines) and the fact that we'd be travelling frequently (we flew into Korea with a Shanghai layover, then to Japan, back to Korea, then back to the US with another Shanghai layover) we decided to one-bag it. I used my standard carry-on sized Samsonite luggage because its lightweight, rolls easily, and fits worldwide carry-on size regulations. I carried my purse, a Longchamp crossbody nylon tan bag, as my personal item.

I planned a capsule wardrobe that would encompass all types of weather we'd encounter there (anything from 50 degrees to mid 80s) and where every single thing I packed could be worn with every single other thing. I used the SmartCloset app to plan out my wardrobe! I planned for soooo long. Like, months. It's actually sad. I revised and revised, I told all my friends how excited I was to wear this wardrobe, I even made an effort to get the original picture of every single item of clothing I brought for the app. Ugh. In hindsight, it still was a ton of fun.

 * Blue paperbag waist shorts (Nordstrom Rack)
 * Black striped jumpsuit (Target)
 * Dark grey cardigan (H&M)
 * Denim jacket (Target)
 
I also brought a Coach black leather belt and some leggings just for travel days.

[**Here's the 14 pieces**](https://i.imgur.com/ej9VFqd.jpg) and [**here's all the outfit combinations**](https://i.imgur.com/xhToVTo.jpg). Well more than a weeks worth of outfits, right? I'll be fiiiiiiine!
 
**Things I got right:**

 * Packing only two shoes. This was a biggie. I decided to wear my AF1s and pack my Birkenstock Mayaris. I wore my Birks exactly twice, then happily wore my AF1s the rest of the time. They were just so comfortable and since it rained so much, I didn't want to get my feet wet. It was also sunny, so I didn't want to get my feet burned. Shoes ended up being the more practical option most of the time, and I never found myself wishing I had brought another pair. If anything, I could have brought good running shoes in place of the Birks. They probably would have gotten worn more.
 * The amount of clothing I packed. It was pretty much the ideal and looking back I would probably still bring 2 shoes, 5 tops, 4 bottoms, 2 jackets, and a jumpsuit again.
 * The variation in fabric and cut. Like I predicted, the extreme low of the trip was 50 degrees, windy, and rainy. The extreme high of the trip was 85 with high humidity walking around outside. So bringing a combination of jeans and linen pants, short sleeve and long sleeve shirts was really great. The fact that everything could layer was another bonus. Also, the blue button down served as a chambray overshirt if I needed another layer that was not as warm as a jacket. Very smart, would do again.
 * THE. PURSE. Dang guys. I bought this on a whim at Last Chance the week before and it made the whole trip for me. It was so lightweight I didn't even notice I was carrying a mirrorless DSLR in it most of the time. It fit EVERYTHING and my shoulders never hurt, which was big because we were out of the AirBnb from 10am-12am most days. Absolutely 11/10. SO happy I didn't bring a leather bag.
 * Brought a second pair of glasses as another element to spice up things if I was getting bored with my wardrobe. Would do again!
 
**Things I got wrong:**

 * I know everyone says this and I thought I did this well enough but it needs to be said again: 1) Only pack things you wear regularly already and 2) Don't pack things you haven't worn enough to know if you like them. Holy crap. It miraculously worked out with the mom jeans, but the black Uniqlo jeans were a nightmare. I had only worn them once before but thought ""they'll be fine!! They're Uniqlo!! It'll be great!"" Nope. Big mistake. They kept falling down! Constantly! They just wouldn't stay up! And what's worse, I only noticed after I was in a position where I couldn't pull them up anymore. The first time I wore them (the hottest day of the trip), it was so hot that I gave up at 2pm and wore a skirt I bought the rest of the day. The second time, we rented Hanbok and walked around Gyeongbokgung Palace. But in Hanbok, I couldn't pull my pants up anymore when they fell down so I basically walked around with pants halfway down my butt. It was awful. The pants were involved in two of the worst wardrobe experiences of the trip.
 * I did not expect, nor could I have predicted, how much the local fashion would interest and influence me. My love affair with linen was just starting around this time but after we got to Japan I just wanted to reinvent my wardrobe. Everything was linen, long, and flowy. I loved it. Anytime I put on my jeans in Japan I wasn't feeling it at all because I so much would have rather been ~a linen goddess~. I bought a ton of clothing the second day in Japan that I ended up wearing the rest of the trip. And more in Korea. You can see where this is going. When I got to Korea, everything was either streetwear or girly (but both ALWAYS polished) that I just wanted to rock some looks I had left back home. Or some silhouettes that were common there that aren't in the states that I loved but didn't own any of. So I ended up wearing only my favorite outfits the rest of the trip instead of the rest of what I packed that didn't excite me after seeing local fashion so on point.
 * The travel pillow was a waste of effort and space and I would have chucked it the first day had it not cost $20.

I bought a Longchamp Le Pliage tote in Japan that I used as a carry-on coming home and I ended up checking in the Samsonite bag I brought because it got so heavy. So didn't quite go as planned with the whole one-bagging thing, but eh who cares! I got some beautiful clothing in Asia. Hope this has entertained you, or at least made you feel better if you too tried a capsule wardrobe and failed like I did.

Gap,"Thanks -- but it's his approach!  Not mine.

I totally remember what I wore, along with the memories and joy of traveling. If my outfit was ""off"" (for whatever reason, including creeping pants like the OP, or shoes not properly broken in, or whatever), then not so much joy. 

I actually remember what I wore when I met my very first love, 35 years ago (cranberry velour slit neck top gold pendant necklace and bootcut jeans). Yikes. And what I wore on first date with current hubby of over 15 years (grey jeans from gap with black merino wool v-neck sweater from Banana Republic and black block heel booties). No pictures were taken. I just remember that shit. Then attach sentimental memories to the clothing, especially if memories were joyful, making it hard for me to get rid of them. 

OMG maybe hubby is doing that? Bringing tired threadbare clothing from 30 years ago that have sentimental memories attached, attaching new happier memories, then saying goodbye while he tosses them in the hotel trash??  Freaking brilliant. ",0.13119834710743802,0.5263429752066116,positive

Flounce mini skirts and asymmetric longer skirts in hideous geometric prints, way too long tank tops (worn under polos and low cut tops), juicy couture, stupid phrases on tees, too tight zip up hoodies, fake Louis Vuitton multicolor pouchettes, soccer mom cardigans that definitely did not look good on my non-Regina George looking ass.

But because I was an actual teenager and not a character in a movie I also wore flare and bootcut jeans with bad whiskering, chunky skater shoes, oversized men’s hoodies, comic book shirts from the target boys department, bad polyester h&m/f21 tops that actually did start falling apart after a few washes, tops with cheap sequin embellishments, Paul frank, a lot of surf brand tshirts from pacsun, and clothes from the limited made for women ten years older than me (low key miss the limited tho).

Flared jeans were still being worn, low-rise denim was good. There were woolen newsboy hats during fall and winter. There was a semi-trend of silky camis and satin bustier corset tops being worn to ""da clubs"", closely aligned with another trend of tops inspired by jennifer lopez' versace grammy dress, under which you'd wear a strapless tube bra. There was also a really annoying trend of the elastic hemmed bubble dress and long tops, which were so hard to iron. H&M came to Canada in 2005 and had a lot of 50s and 60s inspired tweed.

Gap,"Seeing as how 2000's are making a comeback right now, there are fashion items everywhere from that era supposedly. The aesthetics are very nice. Although a couple of months ago I hated anything that resembles that era - absolutely despised low rise jeans for example - I find myself liking the very things i disliked merely because I've been exposed to them a lot. Familiarity does breed liking after all...
But I realized that the people who represent this trend are very young, usually teenagers. I myself am one of them, I was about 8 years old in the mid 2000s. So i mildly remember the clothing of the time, and how i felt that it was the most normal thing to wear low rise denim and wear your sweater untucked. But seeing the trendsetters now, wearing 2000s items, it doesnt look representative enough. I feel like there is a gap between what was actually worn in that era vs what is aesthetic and trending right now. 
I think there are a good deal of people older than me in this thread, and since I can't really remember the fashion of the time when I was 8 years old, I'll ask you instead:

TL;DR:
What did people actually wear in 2000s, that is not necessarily represented in the social media today? What is the most remarkable thing you remember? What were the most mundane items of a regular person's wardrobe at that time?",0.12574500768049157,0.4317747843554294,positive

Gap,"I was a teenager also in the 2000s. I graduated high school 2006.  I have no idea what, if anything (and probably none of it) was actually “on trend”. Going by how popular I was, I’m assuming not lol. Look man, I was just trying to fit in. We can talk about trends and eras all day but in the moment I was just a confused kid with a System of a Down patch her mom sewed on. If this sounds like fads I went through it wasn’t lol. I wore all of this just kind of at the same time.

I also loved MUDD. The IT thing was rawhide in my area. Cooler than cool was having the rawhide laces go all the way up from hem to belt loop but my mom was not about that.

Mine didn’t have the embroidery (I would have said this was “cute” and I didn’t want to BE “cute”) but had rawhide lace ups from hem to knee.   

For tops I was a weird mix of “prep” which I desperately wanted to be - Gap or Abercrombie (I had a super shitty “friend” claim only poor people shopped at old navy.) and goth which my boyfriend/school friends at the time were.  I had this awful camo skirt (I can’t believe I’m actually finding some of this stuff) similar to [this](https://poshmark.com/listing/Camo-maxi-skirt-5fbd19fe446e5921a4f5c5c0?l_con=NWT%2FNEW&utm_source=gdm&utm_campaign=10344682489&campaign_id=10344682489&ad_partner=google&gskid=pla-957701774354&gcid=443531999886&ggid=105979493987&gdid=m&g_network=g&enable_guest_buy_flow=true&gclid=CjwKCAiA57D_BRAZEiwAZcfCxYrqZt5fWLug2Rqxme8bWPAZa29ksvLHpJkZ9VutIGk3IVv25olN0xoCPoUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) but with gigantic cargo pockets, the bottom zipped off at the knee, it had a center seam you buttoned that ran full length, and just bondage straps everywhere. It weighed a ton and I loved it. I’d wear that with a black v neck from express lol.   

Shoes were Etnys (I didn’t skate) with Spongebob laces or adidas. If you didn’t have an LL Bean backpack with your monogram (and it had to be yours - no hand me downs ) then don’t bother showing up for class.

Uniqlo,">Uniqlo Seamless Down Long

Yes that's the one I have. It's so light I and super comfortable to wear. It has a great modern fit unlike some rectangular shaped down coats that make you look like a fridge. Plus it keeps you warm but somehow doesn't get you overheated so no more layering clothes underneath. I can buy the right size to fit me whereas before I would one size up to accommodate wearing a sweater.  Love the coat.",0.25386243386243385,0.48867724867724865,positive
Uniqlo,"TL;DR it's ok to wear in snow and rain. The water won't all slide off the fabric but it won't get absorbed either. I would always brush off lingering raindrops or melting snow when taking off the coat so there's less to dry off and water dripping off in your home. 

It's windproof so that helps to keep you warm and the water-repellent coating prevents the coat from soaking up rain or melting snow. Be careful about following the washing instructions correctly so you don't inadvertently remove the  water-repellent coating. 

Video from Uniqlo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LBTl\_b9-Qc&t=15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LBTl_b9-Qc&t=15s)

The Ultra Warm Hybrid Down Coat is an updated version but essentially the same coat (very warm and water-repellent). What I find better with this version is the non-quilted design on the outside for a sleeker urbanwear look. It doesn't look as bulky as the Seamless Down. The fit is different too I wouldn't buy it without trying it out first. I had to take one size smaller for the Hybrid compared to the Seamless Down to get the fit that I like. 

Either coat let's me just wear something light underneath (no layering). It's not a coat for layering since it's very warm especially if you're gonna be walking a lot. I like to just wear the Uniqlo DRY-EX shirt under the coat. If I'm gonna layer then it's just with a light cardigan.",0.16285714285714287,0.48577380952380944,positive

Madewell often discounts their products significantly. I wouldn’t buy anything at full price, imo none of it is worth the full price. I think I’d spend at most $30 on a top, $50 on shoes, and $80 on a dress if I REALLY loved the aesthetic. But usually I spend about half those prices.

The good thing is, in my experience they were good about accepting returns for damaged items, for example if your T-shirt got holes/shrunk after following care instructions you’d be allowed to return it. Working at madewell taught me about denim care and that in order to preserve your jeans you really shouldn’t wash them. I use this same rule of thumb for sweaters. Instead of washing, after a few wears I’ll get them dry cleaned.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your insight! i should have specified that i was looking for thick, substantial knit turtlenecks and i find that those have been difficult to find fully cotton, as i am sensitive to wool sadly :'( i do agree with others that men's clothing on the upper end scale are definitely *more* expensive and that in turn is because of better construction.",-0.09708333333333335,0.56,mixed

I have a hoodie I bought from H&M 7-8 years ago from the men's section that is still going strong and I remember opting for it because it was cheaper and fleece-lined compared to the women's version which was thin and basically not worth the price. I've often found this with basics!

My cynical self blames it on the same reason why we have a 'pink tax - more value is put into male clothing and they aren't expected to buy and replace their clothes every year.

I'm sure that some of it has to do with tailoring - men tend to be more straight up and down whereas woman have boobs and tend to have wider hips. However fast fashion doesn't cater to longevity because women are the biggest consumers of it. (This is not to put the blame on the consumer, it's the industry that's the problem!)

This is one of many reasons why I'm moving towards slow fashion and ethical clothing - it's better value for money and AFAIK doesn't seem to discriminate against women. Plus so many slow fashion brands are owned by women which is refreshing.",0.11620370370370368,0.5088624338624339,positive

Companies might be 60% right on what the customer want. But they jack prices to compensate so they are still doing well. Like H&M burn a ton of clothes, but are still doing well, because they will profit if they sell 1 item for every 2 they burn.

Companies know the customer wants a dress with pockets in high quality, and it would sell well. BUT the profit margin would be much better on a shitty item with money spent on marketing rather then quality.

Small companies might make the perfect item, but they will be more expensive because of the small volumes, and more sensitive to a bad year. And can't afford marketing.

H&M,"I agree. In many cases, the same basics for men exist for women alongside the hundreds of other options women get. Lots of women don't want 100% cotton because they want things to drape better than that or want thinner, slinkier fabrics or patterns that won't fade. 

In some cases, prices may be different because of the construction. A man's t-shirt is often just a rectangle with sleeves while women's version might have a total different cut. 

There's plenty of sexism in fashion, but women have way more options and cool styles than men. I think a lot of people here would prefer for society to expect them to dress in the same basic unchanging way men do. While I support anyone who wants to wear nothing but suits or jeans and T-shirts or whatever, I long for a day where men's fashion will be as varied and interesting as women's.

If you didn't find enough things on that one trip which might include several stores or just one if she didn't have the time), you better hope something in the literal trash bag the neighbors would give us to look for before THEY donated it would fit. As I've said in other comments, I also had to heavily plan my thrift store trips even as an adult - I used to work 7 days/week, usually 90 hours or more, across several jobs, and still could barely make ends meet. I wasn't hitting up a thrift store once a week, dropping in to see what's new, or hunting for that one perfect item. I was grabbing the jeans in the section for my size that had the fewest holes and had the tag color that was 1/2 off the day I happened to get there, and hoping they'd either fit or I could make it work. It wasn't a lot of ""scouring"" or finding the perfect item like hobby thrifters are doing. You grabbed what fit or could be made to fit, and you put back anything that pulled you above the cash you had on hand, because there was no credit card and you could not tap into the bank account because you wouldn't be able to cover bills. 

Yes, Walmart/KMart etc use the fast fashion model, and other than their very cheap basics, we still could barely afford to buy clothes there when I was growing up. It was often a last resort when time was short (e.g. funeral, and had outgrown black dress) or the thrift store had failed us. Exception being underwear/tank tops/basic tees which they often had under $2 each, which, yes, IS problematic, but is affordable. When I was kid, at least, it was cheaper than places like H&M, which is why I don't think it's valid to say that the reason H&M, The Gap, etc - all places I could not afford to shop when I was growing up or struggling as an adult - exist for the benefit of ""poor people"".

There are really subtle, some even not so subtle, comments that are poor-shaming and how they don't deserve certain things. People are trying to point out those behaviors to educate people and get them to think before they say these things. Unfortunately a lot of ethical discussions have crosshatched with class shaming.

I again said that I didn't say that all poor people could afford H&M. I said some people don't have thrift stores where they live. Different poor people live in different areas and have different problems.

Those are middle class brands, and their marketing skews heavily middle class white.  Cheap enough to feel like you got your money's worth after a season, but expensive enough to feel on trend. And yeah, the only new clothing I had growing up were either gifts from relatives or came from Walmart or Family Dollar. I literally shopped at a thrift store called Bags of Rags growing up, not some trendy, curated NYC ""vintage"" store. They held days where you could fill a plastic bag with whatever fit for a dollar - usually around back to school time.

For example I bought a cute sweater for $15 at H&M and similar styles are $25 at my local walmart. It’s weird to me that the Gap and H&M would get lumped together when at least where I live they are radically different price points. 

When I was going through hardship I thrifted most of my clothes but would buy things like pants from H&M. At least where I live stylish pants are either not available at thrift stores or they are expensive (if you wanted anything that’s not extremely low rise flares it’s going to be $40 plus). I’ve stopped shopping at these places now but I found them to be really helpful to me during those times.

I admit I have not shopped at a walmart in nearly a decade (There were not many in the area I now live in until recently) but I will say, Target prices do seem to be on-par with H&M these days. I chalked that up to the re-branding they seem to have done, but maybe it's more to do with the ubiquity of the fast fashion model flattening production costs. Are Walmart pieces also getting trendier, like Target? They were decidedly not when I was a kid.

I do understand that thrift stores can vary by organization and location. If it's not an affordable option, by all means don't shop there. I just think it's really important to note that no, not all ""poor people"" can afford H&M/Gap/BR prices and it absolutely doesn't fill that niche for a lot of people.

I'm trying to get people to stop villanizing fast fashion when the truth is that it's a necessity for some people. Thrifting and being able to choose your clothing is a luxury that not everyone has. This move that we've done towards being more ethical and trying to make better choices has resulted in people shitting on and demeaning an option that may be the only thing that a poor person has. The truth is also that fast fashion and the chain it creates employs thousands of people. We need to stop shaming a poor person that is buying fast fashion and instead focus our ethics on making the entire fashion world and the chain that it exists within more ethical.

Gap,"We relied heavily on hand me downs as well. Thrift store as a kid was mainly for special occasion clothes - Or taking a trip on a Saturday once a year in August for new school clothes. Sometimes that meant my mother had to turn down a shift or swap with someone so that we could do that kind of back to school shopping, but usually we just, you know, went on her day off. Which most people have even if they aren't rich. If you didn't find enough things on that one trip which might include several stores or just one if she didn't have the time), you better hope something in the literal trash bag the neighbors would give us to look for before THEY donated it would fit. As I've said in other comments, I also had to heavily plan my thrift store trips even as an adult - I used to work 7 days/week, usually 90 hours or more, across several jobs, and still could barely make ends meet. I wasn't hitting up a thrift store once a week, dropping in to see what's new, or hunting for that one perfect item.

They're small-scale, they're produced in a very different environment and from what I've understood pretty much required to be up to snuff vis-a-vis middle-to-high end retail quality and standard of clothing.

The collaborations do a great job making expensive labels within reach for people who can't normally afford designers they like--though it is still catering to the middle-class, but I've always imagined H&M as a relatively middle-class brand, if youthful.

Then again just quality of clothing wise there's always been a scale at HM. The $14 dollar jeans are awful, but the $50 jeans seemed to me comparable to the $50 dollar jeans at anywhere else (the J. Crew's, the Urban Outfitters, obviously we're not talking agolde, but we're also not spending $200).

Though--this actually wasn't always true, you're right that current HM is not as good as it was in the past. I wore a dress from H&M yesterday that I bought in high school for maybe $30 bucks, and in its eleventh year of wear looks exactly the same. I know that primark isn't that good because I bought some shoes from there as a college student that fell apart within three wears. But that's also I think true for all the brands I mentioned.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I purchased a pair of the 10"" high rise in July and quickly became obsessed. Unfortunately, after one or two wears, the back pocked seem came loose. No matter, they fit and flatter me so much, I'll just deal with it. Then, this past week, the seem ripped right below the zipper, in the crotch (I hate that word, ew, sorry). Obviously, I was really disappointed. This is after maybe 20ish wears and two washes. I was pretty much ready to give up on them.

&#x200B;

But I figured I'd try something first... I called customer service to see what they could do. I did not have a receipt because I had it sent one of my bs throwaway emails (I know, so stupid, lesson learned). But the woman on the phone was able to do some sleuthing and found it. She offered to email me a shipping label for me to mail in the jeans and they will either fully reimburse me or replace them! I will still have to go in-store to get the new pair tailored, but it beats having my lady bits on display for the world.

I know Madewell can be extremely hit or miss and it seems like the r/femalefashionadvice community is really polarized on their opinions with the brand. But I'm really pleasantly surprised that they could help me so I figured I'd share since I've read other users have had issues with their jeans ripping. It's totally sad that I'm this pleased by a service that by principal, I think all retailers should offer, but the sad news is that they don't. My first job was at F21 at sixteen and the return policy was and still is abysmal. It's like they wanted you to be stuck with their crap because they knew it was exactly that: crap.

I have returned almost all of the 5 pairs of MW jeans I have ever owned because they wear *terribly.* Every pair I've owned has developed thigh hole. I haven't had a pair last me longer than year. Even after following wash instructions and really avoiding washing to begin with. Sizing up or down didn't fix the problem as was suggested to me in the past, thigh hole still developed. This really gets me going because MW jeans are not cheap. I've ultimately decided that MW jeans aren't meant for curvier girls (I'm 5'0, 125 lbs with thighs that don't lie). I effectively stopped purchasing Madewell and made the switch to Levi's with a keen eye for a higher % of cotton in the materials list. 

Needless to say, I had one MW pair that was my absolute favorite develop thigh hole, surprise surprise. I patched the hole hoping I could go on living my life, when another thigh hole came on the other leg. It had been exactly 1 year since I had purchased the pair and was able to return with no problem. I did have all receipt and documentation though, having learned my lesson with their jeans in the past. They were accommodating and issued me a gift card super swiftly and here we are. 

Still love their store, just not a fan of their jeans. ",0.10150462962962963,0.5418981481481481,positive
Madewell,"Madewell has fantastic customer service--it's why I have Icon status with them since they started the Insider program. Two years ago I'd recommended a coworker a pair of their Billie booties, which they went and bought. The zipper promptly broke and they went back to the store and immediately were offered a replacement, no questions asked. However, the reason why I won't have Icon status with them next year is because I've kind of run out of things to buy; their jeans absolutely do not work for me and wear too quickly, my size apparently runs the gamut from 6 to XXS depending on the article of clothing, and I don't find most of their sandals/flats/heels to work with my arches at all.  I still think of them fondly, but I've been going more towards more sustainable clothing companies within the last year and buying less in general.",0.20512820512820512,0.4371794871794872,positive

For the money spent on those jeans, they should not be wearing down after months. 

But omg YASSS. Now all the jeans I buy are Levi’s, almost always from the vintage 501 collection. Some are more pricey, but it’s all in the material. I would say they’re around the same $$ as MW. I make sure now that the % of cotton is closer to 100%. That makes them more stiff and less flexi, but that has really helped kind of keep everything together and they are SO flattering. I’ve had to get them altered bc I’m short, so I’ll usually get them hemmed and then tapered as well but then you’ve got a pair of jeans made for your body and they look amazing every time! 

I’ve recently bought a pair from Levi’s Made and Crafted collection as well to try and find a more skinny fit vs. the super high waisted vintage 501 look, and love their Japanese denim pair.

Gap,"If you’re getting set odors and stains in your underwear, then there’s a problem in your washing process. One of my core values is reducing waste by extending the lifecycle of my possessions, and that means that I’m very good at fabric care. My underwear and bras smell like clean laundry after they’ve been washed, every time, for years on end. I don’t have period or discharge stains on my underwear because I know that basic pH (bleach) sets protein stains (blood, sweat, etc.), and acidic pH (vinegar) removes them. I wash my clothes regularly so stains don’t have time to set. I only throw away my underwear when the fabric has thinned to the point where it loses its shape retention, which is usually 3-4 years for my Gap Breathe panties, with approximately 12 pairs in rotation. 

It seems ridiculous to me to throw out a perfectly good piece of clothing that’s structurally intact because of how it smells, when smell is a symptom of a systemic washing problem that can be corrected. Fabric care is some fascinating practical chemistry.

H&M,"I know you can be underwhelmed and you can be overwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?

I recently got a new job and, after reading a few posts about it on here, booked a personal stylist appointment at Nordstrom. I'm going from a business casual (one step above jeans) office to a business professional (one step below suits) office and was very much in a style rut. I also rarely buy full price and 90% of my casual wardrobe is from Old Navy or Target, so wanted to get outside my comfort zone. New year, new me, treat yo'self.

I was surprised my local Nordstrom even had this since I'm in a midsize city that's not known for their fashion lol. After requesting a 90 minute appointment, Jenna (stylist) got back to me via email with some additional questions - age, height, shoe size, type of job. I also provided more detail on what I was looking for, including:  
- dress code - I have to cover a tattoo so sleeves need to be elbow length or longer  
- shape - definitely an apple, anything super tight around the waist isn't comfortable  
- colors currently in my wardrobe - lots of black, navy and jewel tones  
- I like ""French girl"" (I know, I know) style and androgynous details, and since I already had 2 pairs of work heels I was looking for flat office shoes (loafers, oxfords, etc)

I was really excited when I showed up and met Jenna, who right off the bat made a couple of comments about how she had a hard time finding stuff because she had to work with the ""bargain brands"" and wanted me to get the ""most bang for my buck"" - not quite the ""go back to H&M"" comment another person here experienced, but definitely ruffled my feathers a bit. My budget was $500-$750 and I was hoping to buy 4-6 pieces - obviously I knew I wasn't walking out with a Theory suit but I thought that was a pretty reasonable amount? Maybe I was wrong?

She took me to a dressing room with stuff already set up, which was fun - 3 dresses, 4 pairs of pants, 4 blouses, 3 sweaters, 3 blazers, 2 pairs of shoes - and asked me for feedback before I tried anything on. There were a few things I was definitely interested in but some things missed the mark already because they were too casual or just colors that don't exist in my wardrobe/flatter me.

Sidenote - I didn't see this mentioned in other posts, but she had me changing in front of her ""to keep things moving quickly."" I didn't mind, necessarily, just didn't expect it - and maybe would have shaved my legs and worn nicer underwear had I known. I also didn't take any pics because she was in the room with me a lot. So heads up.

As we got going, things started to get weird? She had me try on [these pants in camel](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/topshop-pintuck-pleat-wide-leg-trousers/5419836/), which I was not feeling at all - very cheap (could see the pocket outlines), too tight in the butt, plus not a color that goes with any of my current clothes. But when I brought it up she just kept saying wide leg pants are so flattering, this is such a great neutral color....that's fine, I'll try on wide legged pants, just not these?

She was also pushing [this dress](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/gal-meets-glam-collection-jody-belted-ribbed-dress/5435087) REALLY hard - it was cute but again, felt way too casual for the office and really cheaply made for the price. Out of the 3 dresses she pulled it was that, a short sleeved one, and one that I was in between sizes (8 was too tight, 10 was too loose, so she was like, ""You should just wear Spanx and rock the 8."").

At this point I was wondering if this was a Jenna problem or a store problem because it felt like once I rejected the clothes in a certain category she wouldn't bring any more in - I love wide legged trousers, but once I said no to the camel ones she didn't bring in any others. Ditto on the dresses. And when I was trying on pants with this semi-sheer ruffly blouse (nope) I said ""I'd love to try these with an Oxford style button down""...but then she came back with a pussybow blouse with huge ruffly sleeves? At that point I was like, maybe it's an inventory problem and there literally isn't a button down in the store in my size, I don't know.

Towards the end I could tell that she was disappointed I wasn't going to be spending what I said I was (not for lack of trying, she did pull some stuff that didn't work for other reasons) - I was definitely feeling a LOT of pressure to buy something, even if I didn't love it, which was stressful.

What I ended up buying:  
- [these trousters in black](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/liverpool-kelsey-knit-trousers-regular-petite/4810043/) - In Jenna's defense these are great. I'm already planning on buying the green and purple online (which they didn't have in store)  
- [this blazer](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/topshop-marled-open-front-blazer/5440384/lite) - really easy to wear and looks great with dresses and pants, might be too casual for the new job so going to feel it out for a week or two before wearing it  
- [this skirt](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/1901-houndstooth-pencil-skirt-petite/5320450/lite) - Jenna talked me into this one. It was super cute when I tried it on with a black turtleneck and heels, but now that I'm home I'm feeling like there's not a lot of other ways to style it so am debating returning it - definitely would not have bought if it wasn't on sale.  
- [these loafers in black](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/sam-edelman-lior-loafer-women-nordstrom-exclusive/4690357) - Jenna didn't pull these for me, I've actually had my eye on them for a while. I saw them when I walked in through the shoe department and since I felt bad I didn't spend as much as I planned I had Jenna come ring me up so she could get the commission

A few other things she pulled that I liked but it didn't work:  
- [this blazer](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/court-rowe-peak-lapel-plaid-blazer/5372061/) - so cute with jeans but I didn't think I could pull it off in an office without looking like a 1980's realtor  
- [these trousers](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/vince-high-waist-tailored-pants/5375930) - I adored these - luckily(?) I needed to go up a size and they didn't have them in the store, otherwise I most definitely would have blown half of my budget on them  
- [this sweater](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/topshop-textured-pointelle-sweater/5513828) was cute and not colors I normally wear, but way too casual 

A nice thing about this experience is that ""fancier"" department stores have always intimidated me, but knowing that there is actually stuff there in my budget makes me feel more confident to go back on my own.

Overall I had fun trying something new and would definitely give this another go, just not with Jenna. I wasn't sure if the problem was her, the store inventory, or maybe I was too picky, but it just felt like we didn't ""click"" and she wasn't really listening to any of the feedback I gave her - it felt very much like she had a set idea of ""business clothes"" and I wasn't fitting into the mold. I guess if this had been a first date I would say I had a nice time but wouldn't be mad if I didn't get called for a second lol.",0.1034964438683447,0.5217182679579374,positive

It just kind of reminded me of stereotypes of what a certain region's fashion is ""supposed"" to look like (i.e. paris=uber fashionable). To my knowledge the FRUiTS style was more late 90's-early 2000's. I would HOPE fashion trends had changed in the past 10+ years. (which this article touches on).

Uniqlo,"TL;DR. Harajuku used to be a meeting place for fashion in Japan and it was defined by being a place for unique, boundary-pushing style. However, there's been a significant decline (the author states that Harajuku style is dead) for several reasons. It became more popular which caused the vanguards of the style to move on, clothes are more expensive and salaries in Japan have dropped, and new corporations like Uniqlo have moved in.

But Harajuku is still a fashionable place. “People wear a lot less vintage, there is less of a sense of eclecticism and much more mainstream fast fashion.""

---

Personally, this is my opinion of a big swath of Japan's fashion scene as well. A lot of simple, clean lines. As the author says, it ""looks familiar"" and to me it's nice but a little boring. Japan had an amazing fashion scene that was far more diverse than what it is now. Even street style doesn't deviate too much from the norm-core, lightly feminine, fashion that's pervasive today. And I think that's a little disappointing. ",0.11856060606060606,0.5542864873222014,positive

Paling in comparison but a minor annoyance of a related breed is the tank top I got that was straight-up ripped through the strap. There was no way not to notice it, but it obviously wasn't in the picture. The user (on Poshmark) wasn't one of the big-time resellers so they clearly took it out, looked at it, went ""eh"" and sent it along. Obviously it got sent back. This is far from egregious but like, girl, why waste USPS's time like that?

Morbidly curious to hear yours.

**EDIT** We're gonna make this a learning opportunity, folks! Here's a collection of the best-of tips to avoid disappointment and/or contamination of your mind, body, home, and soul.

*Scabies can be transferred from pants! Including trying on new pants! To avoid (and to avoid bedbugs), try sticking 'em in a hot dryer beforehand. ""CDC says: Items such as bedding, clothing, and towels used by a person with scabies can be decontaminated by machine-washing in hot water and drying using the hot cycle or by dry-cleaning. Items that cannot be washed or dry-cleaned can be decontaminated by removing from any body contact for at least 72 hours.""

*Putting clothing in a plastic bag and freezing it for a week can help kill moths/moth larva. I hate the word ""l-rva"" so I'm going to censor it for my sanity going forward.

*Putting a suitcase/new-old clothing in a heated pouch sold specifically for the purpose can help prevent bed bugs, as can the dryer trick, as can (apparently) freezing them.

*Speaking of! Check your wool items for said moth l-rva before you put it in your closet.

*Speaking of wool! Some people sell shrunken/""felted"" items that they didn't care for properly - listed as a size S but can fit your toddler. Try asking about it in advance to create a paper trail if you think you might want to return it. Also, learn how to wash wool once you buy it/before you sell it.

*Check the crotch!

*Ask for pictures of the INTERIOR of a purse before purchasing it, in order to check the condition of the lining. This was people's biggest complaint about buying bags - pretty on the outside, mysteriously sticky on the inside.

*Teeth in a shirt pocket are good luck and should be treated accordingly

*People be nasty and sometimes that's just the nonmonetary cost of thrifting. I said it on here once and I'll say it again: out of probably 500 pieces I've bought in my lifetime, I really only have the 2-3 bad stories. Aside from those unfortunate incidents, mostly things smell like nag champa, have a tiny hole, or are way uglier than I thought, at worst.

*Remember - sometimes, instead of used tissues, you find $20 in a pocket. Yin and yang, baby.",0.002148719336219359,0.5497113997113997,mixed

I think that (thankfully) huge differences in the same size across brands and stores aren't as much of a problem here as they are in the US.

What I wanted to add to that: Judging by the stores where I live, they do seem to offer quite a large plus size collection (much more than shops like Zara or Mango do here).

There's a small article on Elle including the extended ad clip [here](http://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a39110/exclusive-watch-hm-fall-2016-campaign-video/).

As someone else said ""Diversity is hot right now"". Being more age-inclusive and representing other ethnicities respective of society's makeup is realistic.

As far as body types, it's sort of a cheap shot advertising clothes for plus-size, muscular, or transgender bodies if they don't actually make a wide range of clothes that suit those shapes. I'm not plus-sized but I know some people have expressed frustration at H&M's sizing.

Basically what she said was, that they might be using too small sizes because they just keep the European sizes. I can't speak to how consistent their plus size lines are over here, but their straight sizes are very consistent even across countries, in my experience. I think that (thankfully) huge differences in the same size across brands and stores aren't as much of a problem here as they are in the US.

What I wanted to add to that: Judging by the stores where I live, they do seem to offer quite a large plus size collection (much more than shops like Zara or Mango do here). I've not been to the US, but does anybody think that maybe they only take teir most mainstream stuff (skinny sizes and maybe also fewer things in general) to the US?

I'm super picky about my fabrics and fits and styles. The stores I used to frequent, largely out of convenience, are starting to seem not so great.

I am (for myself) tired of the polyester, over-designed clothes at stores like Urban Outfitters, H&M, etc.  When I try to up my game and go to Banana Republic, Loft, J. Crew, the clothes are still polyester, but made for women in offices and maybe an older age-range.

Right now, my go-to is Madewell, but I am still only finding 1 in 100 styles I like, because it's a bit too girly.

I'd prefer options that seem more youthful, edgy, and classic, if that makes sense. Should I be exploring brands Nordstorm?

H&M,"So, it sounds to me that you're experiencing not so much mall store fatigue as fast-fashion fatigue. Remember, it's a relatively recent novelty that clothing is as inexpensive as it is. In the 60s and 70s, you'd be dropping a whole month's paycheck on a good, quality coat or dress - people had less clothing back then, it was just higher quality. That's why capsule wardrobes are so popular among 20-30 year olds right now; You can invest in those classic, everyday wearable staple pieces while dropping less money on the fun, trendy items that you'll only wear a season or two.

Side note, some polyester is of very high quality. Brands like Ramy Brook and 3.1 Philip Lim use some very high-quality engineered Japanese tech poly that feels like crepe/silk, and athleisure items from brands like Sweaty Betty are almost entirely made out of recycled plastic poly. The point is, don't let the material drive your choices too much; Quality is quality. How do you tell the difference? Unless you're buying pre-owned or seconds, you'll know because it'll be significantly more expensive.

Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus, Barney's, and Saks are highly recommended. They carry a wide variety of items; Your price point is going to start around $80 and go to $300 for the majority of quality staples. Shop during sale seasons to get the best prices, but do not shop the Rack stores - most of those items are re-labeled or seconds. If you're near NY or can get there, I recommend going! People always think everything is more expensive in NY and that's true for many things, but you can actually find deals on clothing in the stores; They move through seasonal pieces quickly, and there's just so much to choose from - many items you find in NY never even make the floor in the retail chains. Plan trips around sample sales - that's a great time to stock up on your favorite brands!

Cos is a great store for quality basics, and the price is reasonable; They are the higher-end version of H&M and have stores on the E Coast, S Cali, Houston, Atlanta, and Chicago.  Universal Standard's flagship store is in NY, but they're also carried at Nordstrom. [A.P.C.](https://www.apc-us.com/apps/store-locator) is very good and carried at stores throughout the country. Though, as mentioned earlier, your best bet is probably the big luxe stores that carry a large variety of quality brands as you'll have a lot of choice available to you.",0.2530780141843971,0.44279331306990877,positive

Gap,"I blame the recent popularity of thrifting and the growth of reselling sites like Poshmark and Tradesy. I’ve thrifted 95% of my wardrobe (or more) in the last 5+ years, and I’ve done a *lot* of thrift shopping (thanks to a transition from size 14 to 0/2). At first it was great: legit Burberry, Armani, Versace...especially from this one shop in a rather dodgy neighborhood where everything was $2-5. I’d go any time I visited my parents (about 2 hours away). Sadly the shop closed and I’ve taken to hitting my local Goodwill and Savers quite a bit. 

Times have changed for sure. Prices have gone up, granted I’ve also been spoiled by the better days, e.g. I think $24.99 for a brand new Banana Republic dress is obscene. And there’s so few treasures to be found. It really used to feel like a treasure hunt, and man I enjoyed it. Now it’s much, *much* more difficult. Sure I still find the odd DvF dress or Armani Exchange jeans, but it’s not the boon it once was. 

It’s still OK finding high quality products with lesser known brands (like $250-300 jeans from someone I had to google), but the golden days are gone. 

I’ll take some blame as I’ve resold items from thrift stores online, but I’ve rarely bought items exclusively for that, since I don’t have time to go through every rack and every size. It’s a shame though. I still check the thrift store every month lest I find **the one** version of whatever gap I have in my wardrobe.

I'm super picky about my fabrics and fits and styles. The stores I used to frequent, largely out of convenience, are starting to seem not so great.

I am (for myself) tired of the polyester, over-designed clothes at stores like Urban Outfitters, H&M, etc.  When I try to up my game and go to Banana Republic, Loft, J. Crew, the clothes are still polyester, but made for women in offices and maybe an older age-range.

Right now, my go-to is Madewell, but I am still only finding 1 in 100 styles I like, because it's a bit too girly.

I'd prefer options that seem more youthful, edgy, and classic, if that makes sense. Should I be exploring brands Nordstorm?

H&M,"Hi! New to this sub and looking for advice on ASTR The Label. 

I live in Canada , and their website will ship to me but they don’t accept international returns, so I have to be super sure of sizing before I order. 

I am looking at a dress , and I am typically a true Small in most brands. Abercrombie, H&M, Old Navy, etc. Sometimes with skin tight items I will choose a Medium, occasionally with quite oversized items, an XS. I am 5’3, so verging on petite, especially with midi and maxi dresses. 

The ASTR size chart puts a small at size 2-4, and a medium at 6-8. Most other size charts say a small is 4-6, which is what I’d go with. The dress is fitted under the bust, but flowy around the hips. I’m just not sure. I could go by measurement but as I said the garment isn’t actually fitted throughout so sometimes that’s a bit tricky to judge too. 

Anyone experienced with this brand that could tell me if they tend to fit TTS or a bit small? The dress is called the Maeve Pleated Midi if anyone owns this one or wants to see. TIA",0.10920405352223535,0.46066837203200844,positive

Honestly I feel that if you are purchasing goods from H&M, Old Navy, Urban Outfitters, etc you are supporting a manufacturing system that causes things like this or the Bangladesh factory collapse. 

Of course it's horrifying when stuff likes this makes the news, but if you think this is the only incident in their giant global manufacturing networks chosen solely off of cost you're fooling yourself. It sucks not buying as many new clothes but buying fewer or buying stuff second-hand or on ebay helps hone your fashion sense much quicker anyway since there are so many more options.

H&M,"Say it with me people: ORDER QUANTITIES. We all understand that when you buy more of something, the price per unit usually decreases. Let’s say H&M and Levis order the same fabric for a pair of jeans. H&M needs to produce 100,000 units to distribute to their stores worldwide. Levi’s needs to produce 1,000 units of a special style run for Nordstrom. The fabric is $10yd and the minimum order quantity is 3000yds. Levi’s only needs about 1500yds, so they have to pay $10 + $2 surcharge for order under MOQ = $12yd. H&M needs 150,000yds, so they negotiate the price down to $6yd for the huge order they are giving the mill. The mill is extremely dependent on H&M as a customer, so thy agree to these rock bottom prices. Levi’s just paid twice as much for the same fabric, and their margin is half that of H&M because they are fulfilling a wholesale order for Nordstrom. This is why I roll my eyes at academic studies of the fashion industry because they are made in a bubble that doesn’t consider the actual conditions under which the garments were produced. Someone just buys a pair H&M jeans and a pair of Levi’s jeans and assumes every component of each pair is the same. And this comment doesn’t even go into garment minimums at the factory, but you can assume the math is the same just replace “yards of fabric”‘with “pairs of jeans”.",0.050661375661375664,0.3651322751322751,neutral

Uniqlo,"Yeah. Apparently a lot people buy gauzy blouses with, like, dangling beaded details from Forever 21 and think they can throw it into their agitator-washing machine on hot with their dog's towels, some household rags, and a glug of detergent. The Forever 21 blouse gets wrecked not because it is so much shoddier than the equivalent blouse from whatever midtier brand is pretending to be the second-coming of Quality Jesus today. It gets wrecked because a gauzy blouse with dangling beaded details should be handwashed, regardless of whether it cost $12.99, $112.99, or $1112.99.

Honestly, when it comes to plain, basic garments in plain, basic fabrics, you're gonna get at least a few *good* months out of the cheapest shit even if you ARE washing things totally carelessly. The ""falling apart after one wash"" shtick is dishonest hyperbole and it makes me feel crazy whenever I see it. Plenty of my cheap, plain basics from Target or Uniqlo or Amazon or wherever-- cotton turtlenecks or tanks, socks, leggings, underwear, that kind of thing-- survived many months or years of being thrown into the gaping maw of my apartment's horrible washer/dryer before I learned how to do laundry properly. 

(Edit: FWIW, I don't consider something ""wrecked"" unless it gets ripped, stained, discolored, pilled, distorted, stretched, etc... Some of the damage mentioned in the article-- modest shrinkage or a small amount of rolling/wrinkling at the seams-- wouldn't make me write off a shirt as a total loss.)",-0.025714285714285707,0.5228571428571429,mixed

Gap,"Just wanted to share a couple of insider fyi’s people might be interested in, since I used to work at Gap corporate HQ and also was part of planning and managing boy’s denim at one point. 

1) The degradation in quality overall in the industry happened about 10+ years ago when there was a major shortage in cotton. Most of the worlds cotton comes from a few areas and there were major weather conditions that basically wiped out over half of it. The result was that cotton pricing skyrocketed (2-3x’s the previous cost) and venders were forced to find alternatives such as blended fabrics (synthetics) or lower the thickness of the cotton. Afterwards, even though cotton recovered, many material venders never lowered their prices the the same levels as before the cotton crisis so the quality stayed the same (boo). Conversely many production vendors also realized they could keep costs lower by doing blends and the customer was already used to it now (double boo). 

2) Regarding denim specifically - what makes denim expensive has less to do with the longevity of the material. It usually has to do with the combination of material (grain), wash (color) and wear (eg sand blasted or worn to be softer) that you choose and then the premium for the design style/fit. So in that regard you can’t fully compare “quality” and “cost” in that way directly. Rough, stiff jeans material would last the longest (think worker jeans type material), but they would be unlikely to be considered “luxurious” or sell well because of the loose fit.

On Thursday, September 25th, we are having a Reddit Meetup and Pre-shop at Glendale Galleria in Glendale, CA.  
  
We have space for about 70 people to join us in the store for first access to this store.  This will also be a chance to meet other Redditors from the community.  

**TL;DR:**  
**What:** Preshop, meetup, general awesome time  
**Where:** Glendale Galleria in Glendale, CA  
**When:** September 25th 7pm-8:45pm  
**How:** Shoot me a reddit private message with your name and email.  If I respond back to you, you are in for the event (due to timing this will be a first come first served list, if you can't actually attend please don't message me, you could be taking a spot from someone else).  If you want to bring a guest please make sure to note that (and their name) in the initial email.  I will have a list at the event and if you aren't on it, you can't come in.

To be clear, I'm focusing specifically on pants (so, no jeans) with low/no stretch. **Ratings indicate how well the brand's pants fit a curvy figure, nothing else.**

**Gap: 0/10** everything I tried gaps at the waist (pun intended).

**JCrew: 0/10** same story. I tried their ""slim-wide"" pants hoping that could indicate a curvier fit, but no.

**Talbots: 6/10** has designated curvy fit in pants, which for me, was a strict improvement over the previous 2 brands, but still not entirely correct. I'd say, if your waist is *moderately* smaller than your hips, this could be worth trying.

**Uniqlo: 9/10** surprise of the year! Typically, they design everything for rectangle bodies, so I didn't expect to get very successful there, but this year, their pants are designed to fit extra super-duper baggy, so for a curvy person, it translates into fitted through waist and hips + wide legs.

I like Abercrombie and Madewell since I can get their curvy sizing with a long inseam, but it might not work for someone with a more extreme waist/hip difference.  also those brands might not have nice enough non-jean pants options for you, but they work well enough for me.

tall sizing is great for me at Gap brands but I haven't tried their curvy, if it exists. I think Old Navy has something akin to curvy now? but I haven't seen it from the other Gap brands.

I didn't even realize I needed a curvy fit until about a year ago because my hips and butt don't look especially big nor my waist especially small, probably because of the awkwardly high violin hips lol. I like Abercrombie and Madewell since I can get their curvy sizing with a long inseam, but it might not work for someone with a more extreme waist/hip difference.  also those brands might not have nice enough non-jean pants options for you, but they work well enough for me.

tall sizing is great for me at Gap brands but I haven't tried their curvy, if it exists. I think Old Navy has something akin to curvy now? but I haven't seen it from the other Gap brands.

I liked the bright colors cardigans, A-line skirts, stretch ponte pants, which were work appropriate and seemed age appropriate at the time.

I've bought too many $20 shoes over the years that fell apart or were uncomfortable, and I know you pay less in the long wrong by investing in good quality.

When I started working in HS and could buy my own clothes I mostly shopped at forever 21 and h&m. And senior year of HS I swear I went to the mall like twice a week. 

I don’t buy much clothing anymore and most of it is from thrift shops. They allow me to add things to my wardrobe with minimal investment risk if I don’t like it after a month but without the environmental impacts of fast fashion. Also at my age I’m having a difficult time trying to figure out where someone my age (24) is supposed to shop? I feel too old for forever 21 but not old enough for like most department stores and tbh I don’t know where else to shop? The things I will almost always buy new are shoes and jeans because I have difficult sizes in those. I do like online browsing a lot at Nordstrom but I have to absolutely love and need the piece for me to splurge. Most of the time online shopping and putting it in my cart is enough for me to kill the shopping bug. 

Overall, thrift shopping has made the most influence and now it hurts to buy new clothes because I cringe if something is over like $15. Last time I was in Macy’s my mind was blown trying to think about justifying purchasing a single blouse for like $60.

H&M,"Growing up I went to private schools until high school. For the most part private school uniforms back then were kind of costly, so my parents had to save continually throughout the year. Luckily though our school had a hand me down program for the families whose kids were graduating from 8th grade to high school so we were sometimes able to save on the costs. For the most part our clothing budgets beyond that went to shoes and backpacks, which were some of the few ways we were allowed individual self expression. That was about $100 for all of that.

Once I graduated, I chose not to attend a private high school and entered into public high school. From there I got a few outfits at the start of the school year and maybe for Christmas. As I had to speed through those awkward stages most people go through in middle school during my first two years of high school I bounced around from Hot Topic, Tilly's, Kohl's, and niche little stores at my local mall that have shut down over the years. But we'd got and spend about $150 before school started for everything including school supplies. We couldn't afford much more as my brother and I played sports and had to purchase uniforms and equipment.

Once I went off to college I was very much into fast fashion as I'd joined a sorority and felt the need to keep up with ongoing trends. I would shop Target, H&M, Forever21, Charlotte Russe, etc. It was also around this time that I started wearing accessories regularly, and I discovered a love for Kate Spade bags. So I was spending a lot of money over small but consistent purchases. I could spend $200 in a month or a week back then, I was learning about budgeting through my mistakes but always made sure I had enough for rent and a grocery store run once a month. 

Once I graduated college I started caring significantly less about trends and more about the quality and how long the product lasts because I was tired of things wearing through after only a few washes. Now I only shop at H&M for their basics collection, usually max $50 every 4-6 months, I get my nice work clothes from Kohl's or Old Navy. I now shop at a lot of local boutiques now because they curate their selection for the area I live in. I do the occasional Ross or Marshall's shopping, but usually prefer to get my jeans there as I can get name brands for affordable prices. 

I'm a lot more mindful about my money, but I do seasonally purge from my closet so I do buy clothes every 3-4 months in bulk. I do spend more but I'm buying fewer items now comparatively because I need for my clothes to last longer and look nicer than when I was 21. I'd say my budget is around $200-300 during the times I buy. I don't buy accessories much anymore since it doesn't make sense in my field of work, and I do have that penchant for Kate Spade bags but they're a rare buy these days as I feel like I have enough to suit my needs as is.",0.10902489810384546,0.428864147548358,positive
H&M,"We didn't really have a budget, but I lived in a smaller city in Indiana and did my shopping there. Dillards came when I was in high school, but before that, there just weren't ""nicer"" stores for every day kid wear (there were boutiques that were higher end, but they were like business casual or other more adult looks than what the average 13 year old wears). Forever 21 and H&M weren't around. It was a lot of Old Navy and Abercrombie and Macys and places like that...even though we didn't have a budget, my mom would have us practice math as we shopped. Like, we'd add up totals or she'd say she had a 20% off coupon, how much would the item be? Things like that made us aware of how much things cost and, combined with other money habits in the family, I think it made us more aware of what we were purchasing. I can't remember her really saying no because of costs, but I also don't feel like we regularly went for super expensive pieces? And even though we *could* afford full priced items, both of my parents liked sales and coupons and customer loyalty cards. We wouldn't exclusively use them, but there was zero shame in them either (compared to some friends I had who only wanted to buy things if they were brand new and coupons were gross, etc)

Now, I still don't really have a set budget, but sales and coupons are definitely my friends. But I still live in my hometown and for most of my shopping, there just arent the higher end boutiques.

H&M,"Any non-Americans here?

I didn't have a budget growing up, but that was because my mother used to buy all my clothes, all the way until until I went to boarding school at 15. I remember wearing clothes from a whole host of brands, like Esprit and UNIQLO. As I grew older and started fitting into her clothes she would also give me hand-me-downs which were very good quality, like Burberry coats or Jaeger cashmere jumpers. I guess I never really considered this a problem as a child because we always had school uniforms, so I never thought about clothing much for the 10% of occasions when I didn't actually need to wear school uniforms or pyjamas.

But because my mother bought my clothing for most of my formative years, I didn't have the faintest what clothing prices were like at all. So when I suddenly became in charge of my own clothing from 16 and upwards, I ended up solely buying from fast fashion ... because I thought cheap = good, without really considering the quality of the clothes that I bought. I enjoyed the thrill of acquiring items that were ""my own"" that I ended up buying lots and lots of it. And on a shoestring student budget it's not like I could afford anything else.

My only saving grace was that I was taught how to properly care for clothes, which was why my fast fashion clothing seemed more durable than it actually was. Like I've worn H&M clothing for 5+ years.

Now that I am a young adult working in professional services, I've just started noticing that my clothes were very ... I hate to say it, but ... cheap, compared to what my peers wore. I had no idea why - we were wearing the same shirts and blouses, or so I thought. Turns out there is a difference between polyester and silk/chiffon and I am now just starting to come to grips with what it means to really value quality clothing.

I have been trying to buy less, but better. It has been four months since I bought from fast fashion, and I am still training myself to think of a £40 cotton shirt or a £70 linen dress as ""good value. I'm getting there.",0.22970588235294118,0.45602941176470585,positive
H&M,"I grew up similar. My parents weren’t from wealth but eventually came into it after they moved to the US. Those penny pinching habits remained though.

It took me until I was 22 to finally allow myself to increase my budget and actually buy higher quality items that I truly wanted, not just trendy stuff that was on super sale. I definitely felt guilty for awhile until I realized how much longer my clothes last now. But my budget is still relatively small compared to other folks. I never buy tops for more than $25, jeans for more than $50, coats for more than $100. I used to buy cheap shoes for $20-$30, but now I’m willing to spend up to $100 for a pair.

Anthropologie was maybe not the best example, but there are always a lot of 20-somethings in there, and all of these stores have deep discount sales and clearance as I mentioned.

Uniqlo,"Any non-Americans here?

I didn't have a budget growing up, but that was because my mother used to buy all my clothes, all the way until until I went to boarding school at 15. I remember wearing clothes from a whole host of brands, like Esprit and UNIQLO. As I grew older and started fitting into her clothes she would also give me hand-me-downs which were very good quality, like Burberry coats or Jaeger cashmere jumpers. I guess I never really considered this a problem as a child because we always had school uniforms, so I never thought about clothing much for the 10% of occasions when I didn't actually need to wear school uniforms or pyjamas.

But because my mother bought my clothing for most of my formative years, I didn't have the faintest what clothing prices were like at all. So when I suddenly became in charge of my own clothing from 16 and upwards, I ended up solely buying from fast fashion ... because I thought cheap = good, without really considering the quality of the clothes that I bought. I enjoyed the thrill of acquiring items that were ""my own"" that I ended up buying lots and lots of it. And on a shoestring student budget it's not like I could afford anything else.

My only saving grace was that I was taught how to properly care for clothes, which was why my fast fashion clothing seemed more durable than it actually was. Like I've worn H&M clothing for 5+ years.

Now that I am a young adult working in professional services, I've just started noticing that my clothes were very ... I hate to say it, but ... cheap, compared to what my peers wore. I had no idea why - we were wearing the same shirts and blouses, or so I thought. Turns out there is a difference between polyester and silk/chiffon and I am now just starting to come to grips with what it means to really value quality clothing.

I have been trying to buy less, but better. It has been four months since I bought from fast fashion, and I am still training myself to think of a £40 cotton shirt or a £70 linen dress as ""good value. I'm getting there.",0.22970588235294118,0.45602941176470585,positive

Gap,"How did your parents go about budgets for clothes when you started to pick out your own? 

I grew up with almost all of my clothes coming from Old Navy, Target, and Marshall’s. Not just that, but if it wasn’t on sale/clearance, then I had to think really hard about whether that article of clothing was going to be something I’d actually wear for a whole season or year as a kid. 

As an adult, I feel like I now have to think foreeever about an article of clothing if it costs more than 20 dollars. I buy a few items every year in the 50-100 dollar range that I feel like I truly love, want better construction, or I want to support a smaller company. Some examples are a cardigan from Muji, 2 denims shorts from Afends, a T-shirt from Big Bud Press, and a chore jacket from Madewell. Other than that, I still do a lot of combing through sale sections just like I did with my mom at the same stores from my youth as well as Gap, Uniqlo, and all the thrift stores.

I will get a few things over $50-$100 (5 or so) a year and I’ll have one big splurge up to $500 if I had a good bonus or big tax refund, which kind of happen at the same time.

Gap,"So my parents had very little money when they first had me and my sister but then post 9/11 meant my dad was always deployed. And you know what deployment means? Deployment pay. So we went from most of our clothes being gifts from grandmothers and aunt and random handme downs to shopping at Gap and target and special outfits from limited too or Delia's to start the school year (hello early 2000s). My mom began to shop for her therapy and it became how she showed her love during a difficult time between me, her, and my sister. So it's this weird relationship of not wanting to spend a whole lot of money because that was half of our childhood but I always immediately find myself internet shopping or suddenly at target when I'm upset. 

 I've had to learn that just because its $3 doesnt mean it's going to make me feel better. I dont need 18 tshirts. But that one v neck that fits perfectly and I'm always mad is dirty? Just buy 3. I've learned that size is subjective and that a catalogue of basics with some really cool vintage/statement pieces is what makes a great wardrobe. I dont have a strict budget (~ $300 every 6 months but splurge on coats and shoes) but I generally try to imagine myself wearing something in 3 very different settings for basics, and at least 3 different outfits for a more statement item. 

Some unwarranted advice: 
1)spend the money on the damn boots
2)you need a jean jacket, make it your style but get one
3)learn what shapes/cuts make you feel hot/badass - if you're confident and feeling it, it doesnt matter what's ""in""",0.06876144688644689,0.6025045787545789,mixed
Gap,"This will be buried, but I grew upper middle class. My mom was able to stay at home until I went to school (I'm the youngest of 3). To get out of the house, she worked at Gap Kids. All of my clothes until 1999/2000 came from the Gap. We were that family decked out in match Gap clothing every holiday. 

When I started becoming a preteen, I liked Limited, Too. Then in high school, I was all about Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, and American Eagle. I remember spending $100 on a jeweled jean skirt from Abercrombie when I was 14 (I had spent the summer working and bought it for my birthday, using my own money - I was super proud of it). 

My families financial situation changed dramatically when I was 15/16, so I'd get something from Abercrombie for a birthday or other milestone. Marshall's became more common. 

Now, I'm an adult with a low salary job (teacher). I love my job, but it took me years to adjust my buying impulses. I still shop at Marshall's, but I only buy things I absolutely need or are an amazing deal. My two last purchases were oxford shoes from Marshall's for $10 and my wedding shoes from Zappos.

Gap,"My mum is a shopaholic, I'm pretty sure she's been doing this retail therapy thing for years and years and it's normalised it for me since childhood until I realised that a lot of people don't buy new clothes every week and spend $200+ every time they go shopping. 

As a single child to a single mum, I picked up super weird habits. I am really averse to going shopping with her, because she takes forever (30 min in each shop, minimum) - as a result of this I tend to go shopping alone. I'm in my late 20s now and it wasn't until a couple of years ago did I stop buying stuff because it was 'on sale' - seeing a good bargain and I feel the need to try and fit it into my wardrobe because it looks good and it has a big discount on it. These days I don't go shopping at all, unless I needed something to fill a gap in my wardrobe (most recently - work pants).

I'm only just now learning that you can like something, but you don't have to own it just because it's on sale or you can afford it. I bought so much junk off websites like Aliexpress and ASOS because they're cheap and funky, but they're also low quality and I'm bored with them after a month.

Now I tend to wear clothes until they have holes. A lot of my wardrobe (particularly for work) comes from eBay. If I buy something new it'll usually be to fill a gap in my wardrobe and I want it to last. I'd rather spend $200 on a good pair of jeans than have to buy a new pair every year.

Gap,"I grew up in NYC so you bet there’s some pretty trendy people out here. As a kid my mom never bought me much clothes because honestly, I don’t think she believe we need much. I grew up in a first generation immigrant family, and although we are eventually well off my parents always have had a frugal mindset. Thus, in my childhood most of my clothes are from Target, Forever 21, Gap, Hollister, etc. My mom also tends to look at the clearance section first and see if there’s any sales going on before purchasing things full price that she believes is good quality (keep you warm, last long, etc.). She’s also not big on shopping because my mom works a lot on her business. 

I started buying my own clothes at 17 ever since I got my first part time job. Ever since then my mom stopped buying me clothes. Before that my mom would try to implement a $200/month budget starting high school in which includes food, clothes, and whatever else I would buy. It was never really enough, and I don’t like relying on my parents for money and asking for their approval on everything so I’m glad I’m pass that.

Nowadays when it comes to shopping I admit I do buy somewhat often but I’m trying to cut that down. I tend to buy just one or two items at a time. I think it stems from insecurity as a kid that I didn’t feel like I have enough clothes(clothing deprivation) and that my clothes never looked as good as others my age. I was a bit embarrassed as a kid. I shamelessly continue the tradition of looking for sales/clearance items first, because it just helps me wait a little longer to make sure I actually want to buy it. Similarly to you, occasionally I would spend full price on items I really like and think I would wear often (for example an expensive jacket for the winter or a nice bag). I never really liked the brands I used to wear as a kid, so I enjoy looking around for new brands instead of popular fast fashion brands. Examples of places I shop at lately being PacSun, Tilly’s, etc. Also different brands depending on what I’m looking for like Aerie or Calvin Klein for bras (trust me they’re comfy AF!!). A part of me is glad that as a kid my mom was a frugal spender because it taught me a lot on how to take care of your possessions and not go all out on your urges, despite some embarrassing memories.",0.21837336782458727,0.5316420300566642,positive
Gap,"I grew up in a family that was pretty well off, but my mom was raised really poor, and my grandmother lived in a small town in England during the Depression. so we shopped at a mix of nice places and Goodwill, but we never bought anything full price. My grandmother would take me to Goodwill during discount days with a senior citizen discount, and while we were there she would tell me about what to look for in clothing construction (ex this kind of seam will unravel fast, this is a delicate knit so it won't respond well to sweater shaving, etc). she was a master seamstress and could knit and crochet exact copies of whatever she saw in stores that she wanted, so she also taught me a lot about mending defects in hand knit garments/darning socks/fixing unraveling seams. If we went to a nice store, we did the same thing. 

&#x200B;

we did shop a LOT, though. my grandma and mom both loved clothing, and the idea of a capsule wardrobe that's so popular now would have sent them into fits. my grandma and mom both wore a TON of color and patterns. my grandma's default look was a button down buttoned up to the neck in a VERY bright color and pattern with slacks and comfortable walking shoes. she never wore makeup but loved wearing tons of jewelry, especially bracelets.

as an adult, I never buy anything full price still, although I don't buy as much stuff that needs mending because I know it takes time that I don't always have anymore. I'm obsessed with the half price day that my local goodwill has; last time they had one I landed a bunch of business casual pants from Gap. Recently I've been digging buying stuff from Target and then jazzing it up with embroidery (I'm trying to do a pair of pants with tons of sashiko embroidery because I think it looks cool, and I'm making an embroidered jean jacket themed around endangered pollinators). I definitely trend towards still wearing a ton of color and patterns, although I have bought a decent amount of solid-colored clothing in the last year that I still find surprising. I have tried to get more into makeup than my female relatives, but I always fall back to a relatively minimal eye/skin look paired with lipstick. I don't really buy or wear much jewelry, so I mainly wear stuff that was gifted to me, because my mom likes jewelry and buys stuff to give to me because she thinks I would like it. she's usually right.

One reason why I shop at these stores is because I want to be seen as a little older than I am at work without feeling frumpy. I feel like these stores satisfy that role. They’re not “youthful” per se but they’re not necessarily trying to be. Of course, I could never bring myself to buy anything full price at these stores. Still makes me a customer. 

Yes, they’re mentioned a lot on this sub, but that’s because it’s currently in the mainstream consciousness.

I love reading different perspectives because I think of Madewell, Everlane, and Anthropologie especially for 20-somethings, not that other age groups can't or don't shop there. I don't know what J Crew is anymore, but I used to think of it as the place where 20-somethings shop for their ""first job business casual clothes."" 

Madewell and Everlane I tend to think of as your upgrade from teenage shopping for basics. I do think Everlane is the most ""ageless"" in that lots of women age-wise probably shop there, so I concede their target demo might be wider, but it includes 20-somethings (I see it always recommended for ""affordable basics"" in your 20s).

Madewell,"I mentioned Macy’s and Nordstrom for like browsing and also mostly because I am having trouble transitioning my wardrobe to something a little more mature/more work appropriate pieces I just couldn’t find much else to go too since I felt too old for most ~trendy~ mall stores. 

The other piece of the puzzle is I am looking to buy more ethical fashion. And with my limited fashion budget, that has lead me to thrifting, which I do enjoy but I can’t buy everything from there. I need tall sizes, which I can’t fake with pants but some tops I can make work. 

I like some of Anthropologies clothes, but yeah it really is out of my budget. 
I like some clothes from Target, especially their universal threads since it’s just a madewell knock off. But the quality just isn’t there.

H&M,"Some suggestions:

1. Shoes: Ditch the black running shoes and opt for white laidback sneakers such as Veja or Vans. For boat socks I can recommend H&M, their sneaker socks don‘t slip at all and are relatively cheap.

2. I would still try to show a little bit of skin, such as your ankles and underarms if possible (e.g. wearing cropped trousers, midi skirts or rolled up sleeves). Maybe you could apply some strong SPF and spend more time in the shade to avoid a tan? I just find it very hard to imagine a stylish outfit where every inch of skin is covered, but I feel that just exposing a little bit of skin can go a long way.

3. Combine loose fitting trousers with a tighter fitting shirt or vice versa and avoid combining only baggy clothes. It might be difficult with such a high humidity so best to invest in comfortable, breathable fabric.

4. Accessories: Invest in some basic gold or silver jewellery that goes with every outfit. Maybe reduce the amount of stuff you take with you so you could wear a small crossbody bag that won‘t give you any backpain. I also have a lot of back pain and after I ditched my backpack and started to only carry a few cards, my keys and some travel sized toiletries it has actually improved a lot.

H&M,"My advice when buying new clothes is to buy them all in the same neutral color scheme too. I just revamped my wardrobe and bought only black, beige and white articles of clothing. I had so many clothes, but it was still so hard to make an outfit! Now literally all of my clothes match and it is so easy to get ready.

I was very anti-TikTok for the last few years, but I got it while bored a few months ago (trying not to do work, just relax) and the fashion knowledge I got from TTs is incredible! I have a very short torso and long legs and I was dressing REALLY strange. I'd spend a lot of time scrolling through TikToks and Youtube to learn about how to make the clothes fit better on your body. I was living in black leggings and t-shirts for the last 5 years and I can't believe how comfy my new clothes are! I detest putting leggings on now. I wish I found Tiktok before making such a big investment in my wardrobe, but I can always add more pieces as I go... since I am allowed to buy anything that is a reasonable price in black, beige and white.

My last thought is those boat socks you mentioned.. I tried on like 6-7 different brands and these ones from Amazon were my biggest hit. I ordered like 8 pairs of them so far and only one slides down in general. My husband loves them too. I'm not sure if I can link them, but if you search on Amazon, this is the first hit: ""GSocks Truly Invisible No Show Socks, Non-Slip, Low Cut, 2 Pairs""

Good luck and DM me if you want me to send you any of the links of clothes that I loved from H&M and Quince (not sure if you can get that one where you are).",0.0858539664942104,0.46461197339246124,neutral
Uniqlo,"I've always had a dodgy fashion sense and it's gotten worse with age. Been lurking here for years but it's not helping much. I've been looking at how old I look compared to my friends and today is the straw that broke the camel's back.

I live in a place with 90% humidity. I hate getting tanned so today I wore a loose linen khaki top, loose linen khaki pants, blue merino shirt unbuttoned and a floppy hat. An elderly cyclist behind me who wanted to alert me and didn't have a bell sang out, ""Excuse me, Aunty!"" 'Aunty' is a term we use on elderly ladies. 

I've spent a lot of money (on cheapish clothes, the most expensive I would go is Cos sale items) to get a sense of what works for me. But I always turn out.. wrong. I am envious of my friends who always look put together. Friend A looks like a Uniqlo guy (she's a girl), very clean, earthy and simple style. Friend B looks like Taylor Swift, always in low-cut clothes, makeup, highlighted hair, and just looking like a million dollars at any time.

My style is all about comfort and it doesn't fit into the norm for stylish people.

To avoid the sun on my skin, I would wear long-sleeved clothes and long pants. As I have dermatitis on my feet and have feet issues, I wear shoes and socks. I wear long socks because I am tired of spending money experimenting with boat socks that always slip down. I have back pain so I carry a Bellroy fabric  backpack most of the time. On the rare occasion,  I'd carry a leather backpack. 

I'm slightly round at UK10, with a large round face - I'm trying to lose weight now as I think it might help with looking more modern.

In short, I'm the only person running around town in baggy clothes, covered from top to toe. I look very different from Earthy Friend A and Hot Mama Friend B, so I get why I look old. I don't even have kids.

Uniqlo,"Such great ideas and links here. I am sure there are many ways to wear what feels good and feel more like you’re having fun with fashion while you do what works for you! (With the caveat that fashion is fickle, we ultimately must dress for our own pleasure etc !) 
Sorry if I’m repeating anything, here are some more thoughts just in case helpful:

Beware linen! Yes it’s cool and light but gets crumpled to heck. This does not help anyone look put together. Pants are the worst offenders in my experience, long shirts can also crumple when you sit. Crop-Kaftan shapes and loose skirts hold up much better under actual wearing. 

Structured fabric and shapes: thin denim, canvas and cotton poplin or duck fabrics can allow airflow because they are so structured they hold their shape and sit away from the body. modern shapes like cocoon sillouettes and chore jackets often use these fabrics and look amazing. [community clothing uk](https://communityclothing.co.uk/collections/womenswear/skirts) might be good inspiration. Everlane and Uniqlo occasionally have good items. 

Play with colour? pastels and lots of neutrals can be associated with “boring” or older style. Sometimes some colour combinations just look more hip than others. Cos do a wonderful job in their window displays to take inspiration from - and I think single colour theme outfits (like red with pink, or using only different shades of green) can look amazing and modern. Denim usually looks modern. A bit of colour-theory reading might help you be more confident if this feels tricky. 

Socks: visible socks are awesome! Fashion loves a sock right now. Sporty athletic socks pulled right up, mad colours, glitter, just be purposeful with it. [for example this write-up](https://amp.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jul/08/want-to-look-stylish-pop-on-a-pair-of-socks-fashion)

Zara,"Dude, this is so me. I know you have a million comments already (and they're great!) but I just had to say I have been in your shoes, and am still \~sorta\~ in your shoes now, because I work in a suit and tie, very business formal place. So many of my female colleagues wear extremely girly clothes, too, and I just don't understand how??? like it's so uncomfortable and not me. 

So here's how I fake it, all while staying true (ish) to my sense of style: my first criteria is that I have to be comfortable. I keep a pair of heels at my desk and slip those on when I'm going to be in an extremely formal setting, but otherwise I am rocking the loafers, oxfords, and black leather boots. I also love tuxedo blazers from Zara - I own a black and a white one, and have been for the past ten years or so! I recently had to re-purchase because they were showing their wear... but Zara still sells them. Another secret is - believe it - dresses! Especially black ones. I only wear dresses that are comfortable, but I've grown to love them because they're so easy, and you don't have to constantly tuck anything in, etc. 

The other thing is, you don't need as many items of clothing as you may think. Unless you re-wear the same neon green shirt every other day, people don't really notice. I agree with other people's recommendations to slowly build a wardrobe you will love and feel good in. I love my all-black outfits, but also have a spot spot for plaid, librarian-y clothing as well. I buy very neutral, high-quality clothing and just switch up the look with scarves, jewelry, etc. depending on my mood.

H&M,"I would suggest going to a store that has a lot you can just take to the fitting room and try on (like h&m or forever 21) to experiment and see what you like/dont like, what you feel comfortable in, etc.  Buy cheap things at first while you are figuring out what works for you.  Check out modcloth.com for some more quirky business casual (dressy tops with fun and whimsical prints and the like).  It will just take some experimenting and maybe stepping out of your comfort zone a little by trying new things! And it will take some time so don't get too impatient or buy too much at once.  It took me years to build up a solid base of professional wear, but now I love wearing suits every day (have to for my job) because I've found my ""professional"" style that I feel good in and like the way I look in it. It's very different from my casual style though, and that's okay! That doesn't mean it isn't ""you,"" I guess I think of it as just a different side of me.

And maybe check out Pinterest for ideas to see what kinds of things you are drawn to or think you might want to try. Maybe if you have a friend whose style you like you could take them with shopping to suggest things for you to try.

My work wardrobe (high school teacher) is pretty simple. I bought the Gap Factory Slim City pants in 3 colours: navy, dark green, and burgundy.

I do have some dresses, blazers, and skirts but if I am honest with myself I rarely wear them. I usually get lazy and wear what's comfortable and easy, which is a shirt, pants, and flat shoes with minimal layering.

Ponte pants are a comfy alternative to dress pants if you hate them with your whole heart like I do. They're basically professional leggings.

Button up shirts are easily tucked in and you can get some really fun patterns to keep your funk alive. Express has some great patterns as well as H&M, and LOFT is usually good for them too.

I got 4 pair of H&M cigar flats, which are similar to loafers, and they're amazing. They're a little more interesting than ballet flats IMO, and go with pants or skirts/dresses. They're available in a bunch of colors, I've worn them almost every day since I started over a month ago and just wipe them down with a wet cloth if I get something on them.

If you like more masculine style, pants with suspenders are easy to find right now (modcloth, target, etc) and are fun and professional. Touches of leather like pants or a skirt, or a chunkier watch would work also.

You can also just have a work persona that's separate from your personal life.

Invest in a black and navy blazer, and then add some over time in grey and other colors and patterns that suit your aesthetic.

With these basic pieces you can wear fitted t-shirts that are in good condition or blouses and these are easy to find at H&M’s with some weeding through the other fast fashion garbage. Over the years I’ve scored some really great quality shirts and blouses browsing my local H&M.

Another huge help has been local consignment shops and surprisingly Stitch Fix. I don’t really have the spare time to thrift shop which sucks, I’ve found some great staples over the years, and I figured Stitch Fix would be too expensive. It’s a running joke at work that anytime the other women go to H&M I’ve already bought the shirt and worn it so I wanted to branch out. 

The first one was a disaster and I only purchased one shirt, so I changed stylists and filed out some more of their style questions. The second on was a miracle. I needed a new pair of jeans and some work blouses. The jeans she sent fit like a glove and look amazing, as well as all three shirts and the earrings. With my discount the whole thing cost me $155.

Uniqlo,"I really feel this. So try to stick to things that still feel comfortable and true to you but meet the dress code criteria. Instead of converse buy some cool flats...I would advise a couple basic pairs that match everything and a couple pairs with bold colors or interesting details to make them stand out. Same with clothing, a few basics like white tees, black pants, etc and then throw in some funky prints or intense colors. When you put together outfits pick one stand out item (the bold shoe or the printed blouse) and combine it with your neutrals. You won’t look like a crazy person but you will retain a hint of weirdness while remaining professional. Also, I find a black manicure helps me hang on to my inner goth!

UNIQLO is good for basics that are higher quality than h&m etc, although their fit is sometimes sort of off in my experience so I like to try their stuff on. Everlane also makes really good basics, their wide leg cropped pants are amazing and I like their t shirts. For fun prints and patterns try ASOS. They also have fun socks and tights, which are another way to mix it up.

My work wardrobe (high school teacher) is pretty simple. I bought the Gap Factory Slim City pants in 3 colours: navy, dark green, and burgundy. I like them because they have a lot of stretch so they're comfy and they fit easily. For tops I wear white, cream, beige, and burgundy turtlenecks, blouses, and crew neck sweaters. Basically everything goes together without too much thought. For shoes I have black Chelsea boots, burgundy loafers, and camel oxfords. 

I do have some dresses, blazers, and skirts but if I am honest with myself I rarely wear them. I usually get lazy and wear what's comfortable and easy, which is a shirt, pants, and flat shoes with minimal layering. 

If you want to save money I would go with Gap Outlet, Old Navy, H&M for some good office basics. For something trendier but more expensive try Aritzia, Everlane, Club Monaco.

Madewell,"not who you asked, but you'll find in the 9-5 world that it is not difficult to have a work life and separate it from personal life. For me, I start my commute mostly ready for the day but have to listen to my music and I wear flats or flip flops while driving. I get to work and put on my heels after I park, click clack into my office which plays John Mayer pandora radio all day. I don't bring up personal relationships or problems, I leave those at the door. My coworkers know I like to bake because I have brought them things I've made, and during office hours I'm always there to console them if they need, but I don't share my social history at the water cooler, etc. I know that my coworkers will never see me on the couch watching netflix in my comfy clothes; they won't see me dressed up for my dates, etc. It's ok to keep your personal life private.  


But if that isn't for you, maybe look into some desk decorations to share your style or taste in music. The first two weeks you might struggle with what exactly is appropriate in the office, but maybe you come to find that your black jeans can be acceptable when paired with a nice top/blouse/sweater or even just a small heel/bootie. Find some accessories you can wear that you like and wear them outside of work and at work if you need to help feel like yourself in work clothes.   


Also, a tucked in top doesn't have to necessarily be an Oxford button down. Head over to Nordstrom Rack/Marshalls to find some alternatives. I recently found a top similar to [this](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/2762980/madewell-central-stripe-shirt?color=RUSTED%20CLAY) which is 100% cotton and a little different from my typical work top that i love so much I've worn it out in public not tucked in and without heels. I would 100% recommend just going to stores and spending time trying things on--the more you do, the more you'll get a feel for what work place clothes you can branch into comfortably. No need to buy anything, but set aside an hour or two to just try on a variety of different tops (hint: stay within the same/compatible colors so you have a more versatile work wardrobe!). Once you find out you need to get skirts/more professional pants/if a simple dark/black flared jean is acceptable, you'll be able to figure out what is more acceptable in your workplace. It's also totally ok to try and copy someone else's outfit while you're figuring it out!

So you have a ton of rules & regs but no legal teeth or no social consensus in that country about how this stuff should be handled. 

It's one thing that bothers me about western moralizing - no I don't *at all* think anyone should be working in unsafe or inhumane conditions because that's a human rights issue. But, how is that country handling the issue? How do they handle the issue in other areas of their economy? How can they create safer systems? I see lots of protests from factory workers now and that encourages me. It reminds me of factory protests in western countries in decades past. But sometimes I think people really, really overestimate the power of places like The Gap to create policy changes abroad. If all these companies up and left their countries of manufacture tomorrow, you would have an insane shit storm to deal with *and* you wouldn't make the situation better because you don't have that much power even if you all pulled together and formed some Large Clothing Corp Alliance of America For The Betterment of Factory Stuff.

This is why, imo, investing in things like education of girls and business opportunities for young people in these countries can pay off hugely because then you're going to see changes coming from that country and within that country.

I choose my best size guess, and if it doesn’t fit but I love it, I just exchange it for another size. If the quality is not what was represented online (e.g. it has a sheen but appeared matte in photos), then it gets returned. The GAP pants in question I’m not too terribly bummed about. I liked them, bought them in-store with my partner waiting so I was kinda rushed into it a little, and then later decided I didn’t really need them and I’d rather spend that $60 on groceries. I don’t normally do that, I normally just don’t buy in the first place, so it’s fair that the company wants to keep my $60 especially since nobody is buying those pants and they’re now like $45. 

The only part I’m a little miffed about is that they didn’t email customers about the change in return policy. But I absolutely agree with you - until a few years ago I couldn’t even fathom somebody buying a ton of stuff and returning all/most of it as, like, a hobby (weird) and I think people buying, wearing, and returning stuff is gross behavior. I specifically despise Athleta’s policy that you can return something after wearing it if you’re not “satisfied” - all that does is raise prices for everyone. I would never, ever return something I’ve worn. So yeah, I agree that overly-generous return policies need to stop. I’m not mad about it, but I do think customers have the right to be notified when a policy changes. It’s also better to tell us.

Everlane prices have gone up a lot since 2020, maybe 40-50% for some items. I tried to get their Way High denim shorts last year (they were exactly what I was looking for), but after ordering no less than 3 pair (one at a time) I gave up. All 3 had major defects (one side longer than the other, twisted center seam) and while customer support was very kind and understanding I just kinda couldn’t be bothered anymore. But their pima micro rib tops are my favorite; I think they used to be a fantastic deal at $30-40 each, now they’re $40-50. My main complaint is the textile is not the best quality - it stains easily. But the fit is exactly what I love, and hard to find (I’m referring to specifically the turtleneck and funnel neck tops).  Prices of their denim are now on part with Levi’s and Madewell but they don’t run sales, so I don’t think Everlane denim is anything to write home about (quality or price).  Banana Republic has improved their quality a lot, but has also majorly hiked their prices. I’m eyeing their Lido wool pants (just a simple career pant, but I need black wool pants like that, but I think $150 is a little too much. For $100-125, I’d get them full price…but I don’t know, maybe they’re also worth $150.  I find it very hard to sort out what’s a reasonable price in women’s clothing vs. what’s clever marketing to justify inflated prices. I will say that BR seems to have certain “seasonal” lines that go on sale up to 40% off (final sale online) and then separate lines that never go on sale (Lido pants are part of the latter).",0.16485347985347987,0.4822069597069598,positive

H&M,"For me, fast fashion typically means items that will only last 1-2 seasons. In college I bought some H&M tops that got holes within a few months. This taught me that it may seem like the price is right, but you can end up paying more in the long run. The last mistake I made - I bought one shirt at Target that looked nice for my daughter and it pilled the first wash and got a hole within 1 month. 

So I won’t buy at Target or H&M again really. We do shop at Old Navy and I’ve had good luck with some of their items: namely rain jackets for the kids (these have lasted) and 100% cotton button downs for my husband. His button downs have lasted years, and the quality on them is solid. I try to avoid the cheap polyester stuff.

Now a lot of retailers that weren't fast fashion but still used shady labor and environmental practices have BECOME fast fashion in order to keep up (Old Navy comes to mind). 

The sustainable way to shop is to reduce, reuse, and then recycle. No one can be perfect in this, but if this is how you are generally living already then I think you can give yourself some grace.

H&M,"""Slow Fashion"" is often a misnomer- there have been multiple companies that use ""ethical consumption"" as their marketing differentiation, but upon further research it's been discovered that those companies aren't *actually* more sustainable or ethical than ""fast fashion."" They're just more expensive ""fast fashion"" with greenwashed marketing.  


It's a trope to say ""there's no ethical consumption under capitalism"" but I think we can drive ourselves crazy trying to find affordable clothing that is also ethical. Realistically, like others have said, it's better to purchase rarely but intentionally. Inexpensive clothing isn't going to just get destroyed in a few wears, so focus less on where you're purchasing from and more on what you're buying and if it's an impulse buy that you're not going to actually wear.  


It's something that comes up in this sub so often... ""I washed the shirt once and it's already falling apart!!"" but I think that actually almost never happens. Basic clothing maintenance goes a long way, and if you're avoiding hyper-trendy items and taking care of your clothes, your garments can look great for a long time.  
Cheap, fast-fashion retailers are probably all similarly problematic, but we decide how much of that we consume. There's also definitely some xenophobia involved in the way we talk about fast fashion stores being worse than others. Shein gets railed on constantly, but I don't really think there's anything distinctly worse about Shein than F21, TJMaxx, H&M, etc.  
Realistically, Shein gets the worst rep *because* they tend to do microtrends and sell huge amounts of garments inexpensively, but it comes down to our consumption decisions and caring for our clothing like items aren't disposable. I'd rather someone shop on Shein for basics that they will care for and wear for a long time than to see someone running to Target and getting a ""haul"" of new clothes every other week.  


So, like other commenters have said, don't stress about trying to sort through the marketing about what is or isn't ethical. Learn how to do simple clothing repairs, take care of what you do have, and resist the impulse-buying that is the core issue with fast fashion.

H&M,"This was interesting for me to read your question. Unfortunately at this time “fast fashion” or unethical shopping is hard to avoid entirely but can be reduced. Like others mentioned, stay away from obvious fast fashion brands like FN, SHEIN, H&M etc. Shop better quality, more sustainable and less clothes. Also try a capsule wardrobe. The capsule wardrobe is my way of reducing harmful effects of fast fashion. Also, now I am blessed to be able to afford tailor made clothes. A lot of my wardrobe is now being sewn by a local dressmaker/tailor. I know I am very lucky to be able to do that as that option could be out of reach for many. But if someone can afford it, I think they should consider customizing their wardrobe. I have also recently seen many brands discuss their sustainability and ethical practices.

My approach is to be very mindful about the kinds of clothes I actually wear and how long they last in my closet. I try to shop secondhand before buying something new—e.g. I buy a lot of stuff secondhand from sites like Depop and Poshmark, which also saves some money.

Gap,"I live in the Midwest in America. Not rural, but definitely not New York or LA. I do not trust the thrift stores in my area to sell clean-ish clothes and our Plato’s Closet type places mainly sell outdated early 2000’s low rider jeans and tube tops. Not really my style. 

So in the quest for sustainable living, Ive been reading about fast fashion. I’ve never bought from Shein or anything, but most of my clothes are coming from mall stores. American Eagle, Aerie, Gap, Old Navy, etc. Then I read an article that says all of those are fast fashion. So…where exactly do I shop if I want to avoid that? I’m pretty much done purchasing at this point, but I’d love to keep some stores in mind for the future, should I need something in the future. 

What online/brick and mortar stores aren’t fast fashion? I feel like EVERYTHING is fast fashion now. Outside of thrifting, what options are there?

I mean, I feel like the criteria basically means everything is fast fashion. I bought some vans the other day and they were on the list I looked at this morning. Same with Birkenstocks, AE, Gap, J Crew, etc etc. I can’t imagine any major retailer NOT being fast fashion. And if that’s the case, then what’s the point of trying to avoid it? Unless it’s online, fast fashion is all I have access to in person.

ETA: wow! This really opened up a great dialogue about what fast fashion is and how to avoid it!! I just think I had a bit of panic, because the google wormhole made me feel like there’s no way around it. I think this line sums up how I’ll be looking at my choices going forward:

“Fast fashion worn slowly”. Buy well made items, take care of them, and wear them for as long as possible. And go thrifting.",0.10668509418509423,0.4488841113841114,positive
Gap,"I think this is a great comment in general, and particularly for OP who says that the stores she can access are fast fashion. I tend to shop at Gap/Old Navy as well (mainly because I’m very tall, and I’ve found it hard to find clothes that fit from sustainable brands). I’ve had clothes from fast fashion stores that have lasted for years. 

I think a big risk of shopping fast fashion (even if you intend to wear stuff till it falls off your body) is buying too much volume. Those stores have great sales and it’s hard to not be sucked in and think you need 10 t-shirts instead of 2 because they’re only $5 each.",0.18666666666666668,0.5033333333333333,positive

I just can't imagine buying sth to throw away in less than a year even if it's 'cheap' clothes. Even if they're not made to last in theory, in my experience, it's not like an average person would notice any changes (bc it happens slowly) and think ""ugh the shoulder of this shirt doesn't fall exactly the same as it did 7 months ago, I'm throwing it away"".

If anything, I think the main problem for the people who are more wasteful is more about trends (rather than whether sth lasts or not). Like they buy a shitload of cheap trendy clothing and once sth is out of trend they just buy another shitload of cheap trendy clothes.

Madewell,"I was reflecting on my current wardrobe this morning and started thinking about a common misconception regarding oversized clothing. For context, I’m nearly 3 months postpartum and slightly overweight for my height (5’5”).

Most of my tops, and some of my bottoms, are oversized. That’s how it’s been for years now, not just during this postpartum period. I simply enjoy the look of a really oversized t-shirt or sweater with tighter pants. I’ve even been straying away from the “loose on top, tight on bottom” formula recently due to a pair of white pull-on jeans from Madewell I purchased. They’re slightly baggy & I’ve been loving them with all my oversized sweaters.

However, I have this nagging thought in the back of my mind that people think I’m wearing oversized clothing because I’m uncomfortable with my body. I feel like this is a super common narrative; that baggy clothing is to “hide” your body and that it makes you look bigger than you are. I’m honestly not all that insecure with my body postpartum (I’m technically overweight but gained less than 20 pounds during my pregnancy & lost it all + another 10 pounds by the one month mark), but since people obviously know I just had a baby, I feel like they might assume I’m covering up on purpose.

It totally doesn’t matter what others think, but this notion got me thinking about other common misconceptions regarding fashion/how you dress. Can you think of any others?",-0.021191154524487856,0.44246710080043417,neutral

I have always been comfortable dressing in Zara + light goth/subversive type, which also suited my past budgets. But I have been opting OUT of things, due to age-appropriateness?

My best advice would be to look at the item description for the fabric and avoid things like Viscose and polyester on things like t-shirts and basically just anything that looks like cotton but it's not. Usually after the first wash it's going to start looking bad and unlike cotton synthetic fibers don't absorb sweat and the smell. If it's a shirt type material like [this](http://image.dhgate.com/albu_262020864_00/1.0x0.jpg) then it's fine for it to be polyester. Sometimes they even sell blazers from that material and it's fine as well. but if it's something that looks like it should be cotton or some thick fiber like [this](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/606006039/New-Vintage-Style-Women-s-Plaids-Suit-Leather-Patchwork-Cotton-Jackets-Ladies-Long-Sleeve-Winter-Blazer.jpg) and it says it's made from polyester then avoid it like plague.

I would consider them comparable in quality to Zara, definitely far above F21 and the like. They're awesome for relatively inexpensive professional wear and smart casual pieces.

I currently have several nice tanks from their casual collection and a pair of dark skinnies with zipper details, which quickly became my go-to pair. I also have a black linen breezy dress from Mango outlet and a thrifted boyfriend cardigan, which is still holding up too.

Mango,"I've bought 5 pieces from Mango. At this point I've had them all a year. 

First of all, their sizing is super unreliable. Almost everything fit great but one top was huge. I took it in and it's fine, but still pretty weird to have one piece be sized really odd. 

Jeans I bought - still pretty good. No real complaints. 

Plazzo pants - PERFECT, but when I hand washed them cold  and hung to dry (as per the care tag) they shrunk at least a full size and lost 3"" of length and are now completely unwearable. 

Shell - kinda shitty polyester fabric and this is the one I had to take in. Even tho I'm not a fan of the fabric it's worked well for what it is and I'm overall pretty happy with it for the low price point. 

Tunic tshirt - FANTASTIC drape. Love it. But it does bleed color (black) when washed and the entire boob area is super pilled - and I have enough clothes that realistically no one item gets a disproportionate ammount of wear. It's definitely pilled faster than anything else I own (F21 included)

Black tunic - again, great drape but it started developing holes at about 6 months. By now it has holes and is pretty thin. 

For what it's worth, I take VERY careful care of my clothes. They don't get washed every wear and when I do wash them these have all gotten hand washed and hung to dry. Overall I'm very very disapointed with the poor quality and won't buy from them again. ",0.17512195121951216,0.6194715447154474,positive

Mango,"I purchased a couple Mango items in Spain 2 years ago. I got a nice linen-cotton shirt with metal buttons, and a knit linen-cotton sweater with abalone shell buttons. The quality of detail was pretty good -- the clothes were cut appropriately along the lines of the cloth, the edges of the seams were wrapped (no fraying edges). I think it is far better than the vast majority of H&M. I have found durable items under H&M's LOGG brand, but never with that attention to detail -- their clothes usually have plastic buttons, and ragged edges/threads.

If you like more boho styles, I think you can also find good prices on Spell stuff. I've found dresses for $150 and less and < $100 tops. I actually snagged a Spell sherpa jacket on Free People's website for $99 today! 

Which also brings me to Free People - which can be very, very hit or miss. Very. You really have to check reviews but they've had some great sales lately and most of the dresses and jackets I've purchased there have been good quality that's me lasted years.

I have a pretty decent track record with local & online boutiques that sell brands like Oli + Hali, POL, Easel. 

H&M and Abercrombie are both two hit or miss places for me. H&M has pieces that are really amazing for the price, and then there will be a random sweater that is just terrible quality.

Zara,"First time poster in this awesome sub :)

Let me start off by saying that I’m speaking from an incredibly privileged point of view, and at the end of the day this post is nothing more than first world problems at their peak → the luxury of having the time and means to care about fashion and the clothes I choose to wear. I’m very well aware that my position in life is, in comparison to the vast majority, one of extreme privilege and fortune. I’m a white, young, conventionally attractive, thin, middle-class cis woman living in a country with one of the highest, if not the highest, living-standards in the world.

If you don’t like to read on about my complaints, I totally understand. This is mostly a babbling rant anyway with a very negative view, so I apologise if it makes anyone upset.

But now let's get to it.

I’m so fed up with fashion. I’m struck with decision-fatigue, insecurity and frustration. I know that I really don’t have to care about it, that I’m free to yell “fuck it” and only wear onesies and ugg-boots for the rest of my life (no shade). However, I also live in a country/city/social environment where caring a great deal about your clothes and spending lots of money on it, even as a student like me, is the norm. At the same time, I also love fashion. On others. I always notice what people wear and absolutely love it when people have an original style, look effortlessly cool, well put-together, or over-the-top. I don’t consider myself a snob when judging others clothes by any means, that is not what it is about, I simply like looking at clothes and the people wearing them.

After quarantine since March I’m back at university and I feel an insane amount of pressure to look good, “chic” and “in” every. single. day. I need the right jewelry, the right clothes, the right shoes - even the right backpack to “play the part”. The last couple of weeks has been extremely stressful as I’ve tried to accumulate new clothes that I like for the semester, with very little success so far.

I also feel like clothes are way too powerful when it comes to expressing who we are and building our identity - especially for women. For some, this is an advantage and cornerstone in their love of fashion. For others like me, it leads to identity-crisis, over thinking and decision-fatigue. I don’t know who I am, and I certainly don’t know how to express it through clothes, or if I even want to. Another redditor made an excellent post here about being “marked” as a woman through clothes and I felt that in my soul. I feel uncomfortable with being looked at and having to navigate what to wear and how based on my gender, and the messages implied in my clothes (in the eyes of especially men).

As a woman, I’m also completely exhausted by how quickly fashion changes and the sheer amount of options. I’m not the type who wears things that are only trendy for a short while, yet the things I wore last autumn already look a bit dated in some ways, or have been worn out due to poor quality. I simply can’t with having to buy new stuff all the time, it feels greedy, time-consuming and wasteful. Wandering around aimlessly in fluorescent light in H&M or Zara, wanting to crawl out of my skin in the dressing room as I try on yet another, ill-fitting thing as most female clothes are poorly made without regard for different body types. Even I with a very ““standard”” body struggle with odd fits all the time, I can only imagine how others feel. At the same time, my boyfriend lives happily in the same nice pants, shirts and denims season after season. I know people will say that an answer to this question is “timeless classics”, yet the cut of jeans and pants etc. changes over the years too, and no one wears striped parisian boatneck tops where I live, so yeah, the “timeless classics” aren’t that timeless after all IMO. Also, these items are only timeless from a very specific, eurocentric point of view, so while I can only appreciate the help and ease it brings others to rely on these basics, it’s not the solution for everyone.

I’ve almost run out of words now… I feel like I’m chasing intangible ideals and hating myself in the process. At the back of my mind lurks guilt and horror of the outright disastrous environmental and humanitarian problems with the fashion industry, problems I actively contribute to with every desperate purchase.

Whew.

Do any of you recognize this ambivalent relationship with fashion and your clothes? Or like me feel like it takes up way too much of your mental space or feel pressured into giving way too many fs about the clothes on your back? How do you deal with this pressure of what to wear or comments on your appearance?

Or, if you disagree or come from a totally different viewpoint please let me hear your thoughts as well, I'm very interested!

TL;DR: I feel pressured into caring and putting more effort into my clothes than I’m capable of.

Zara,"I’m going to respond to this from a privileged perspective as well.  IMO your fashion fatigue sounds like its coming from buying cheap clothing.  Don’t get me wrong I love some things from Zara but I haven’t shopped at an H&M, F21, or any similar stores in years.  You sound how I sounded at one point.  Looking through my closet and I felt like everything was cheap shit that didn’t completely fit me the way I wanted and when I went out I felt like I looked stupid.  I made a decision to stop buying garbage.  I went through my closet and donated every cheap item of clothing.  I started educating myself in clothing, designers, fabric, craftsmanship, etc.

I spent money on tailoring and beautiful quality items that I knew I would have for years.  Even if it meant saving up for months for something.  BUT when I went out in these new quality designer items I felt like a million bucks!!!  Nothing could bring my confidence down.

Fashion doesn’t define you, your identity, or who you are as a person.  It can be something to help you shine your inner light just a little brighter or it can be some thing fun that you enjoy (or both!). It is what you make it.

Now, I love finding new emerging designers or startup labels and of course I still love my staple designers and stores.   If some thing isn’t perfect for me I don’t buy it.  If the craftsmanship and fabric quality is garbage I don’t even waste my time with it.

Edit: I’d also like to point out who cares about anyone else.  For example I’ve been wearing high waisted jeans for years, even before they were “in”.  Why?  Because I hate the way low rise jeans/pants look on me.  I remember a friend of mine asked me once “are high waisted jeans in right now?”  My response “I don’t know and frankly don’t care”.

Zara,"It helped me a lot to realize that I don't need to have every piece, wear every color, or try every trend. It's better to curate a personal style that suits you and that you enjoy, regardless of what's trendy or not. Clothing that fits well but isn't on-trend will look much better than trendy pieces that don't fit. It's also better to invest in higher quality clothing for pieces that you'd like to last. H&M and Zara mass-produce clothing to fit with quickly changing trends, and they just don't put a lot of resources towards quality or fit. It's great if you need a club dress that you know you'll only wear occasionally, or for an accent piece that won't stay in your wardrobe for a long time. But you'll want better quality in pieces that you wear every day.

What do you actually \*like\* to wear? And what pieces do you actually need to suit your lifestyle? For example, I hate shorts, so I only keep two pairs for camping trips, and they are cheap. I don't like high heels, so I don't buy them. But I keep my work blazers for several years and wear each of them at least once per week, so I make sure that those are higher quality, and I'm a lot pickier about what fabrics and cuts I like.

It also helps to figure out which colors are flattering on you and/or that you enjoy, and try to mostly stick to buying those. If you stick to a specific color palette you can get to a point where matching is no longer work, and everything just kind of coordinates with each other. I do a lot of black, burgundy, and dark purple, so everything I purchase tends to coordinate with those colors.

I try to be realistic about how much clothing I need based on how often I wear it. Pre-pandemic, my closet featured a lot of office clothes, a couple fun going out dresses, two pairs of jeans and some casual shirts for weekends, and a couple workout outfits for the gym. Make a plan based on how many outfits or pieces you actually need, and then stick to it, replacing items as they wear out or if your lifestyle has a dramatic change (transitions like university to the job market, or a switch from a formal office to a more casual one, traditional office to working from home, having children, etc.) that changes your clothing needs.",0.1696666666666667,0.49823456790123455,positive

I’m not a big in person shopper except during Black Friday and Dec 26 sales- on those days I hit up Saks and Neiman Marcus!

My all time favorite high end designers are Rick Owens and Tom Ford- although I haven’t had a reason to buy anything TF I love everything he does.  I also love Cushnie and bought a beautiful Cushnie leopard print silk bodysuit right before Covid-so I haven’t even had a chance to wear it yet.

Mid price I’m currently loving Sablyn, Enza Costa, and Alix for bodysuits.  I also am currently loving Jaquemus and Brandon Maxwell- two designers on the rise!  On the lower end I like Zara wool coats and Naked Wardrobe sweater dresses.  
I really like Naked Cashmere sweaters (great quality!) and I also love The Reformation T-shirt’s!

AGolde are my go to jeans.  Their high waist designs are super flattering.  Great fitting jeans are a must have!

I have no specific favorite shoe or accessory designer although I do love Chloe bags and their bags are definitely an investment item- but I also wear the same bag until it falls apart.  I get my money’s worth!

H&M,"First time poster in this awesome sub :)

Let me start off by saying that I’m speaking from an incredibly privileged point of view, and at the end of the day this post is nothing more than first world problems at their peak → the luxury of having the time and means to care about fashion and the clothes I choose to wear. I’m very well aware that my position in life is, in comparison to the vast majority, one of extreme privilege and fortune. I’m a white, young, conventionally attractive, thin, middle-class cis woman living in a country with one of the highest, if not the highest, living-standards in the world.

If you don’t like to read on about my complaints, I totally understand. This is mostly a babbling rant anyway with a very negative view, so I apologise if it makes anyone upset.

But now let's get to it.

I’m so fed up with fashion. I’m struck with decision-fatigue, insecurity and frustration. I know that I really don’t have to care about it, that I’m free to yell “fuck it” and only wear onesies and ugg-boots for the rest of my life (no shade). However, I also live in a country/city/social environment where caring a great deal about your clothes and spending lots of money on it, even as a student like me, is the norm. At the same time, I also love fashion. On others. I always notice what people wear and absolutely love it when people have an original style, look effortlessly cool, well put-together, or over-the-top. I don’t consider myself a snob when judging others clothes by any means, that is not what it is about, I simply like looking at clothes and the people wearing them.

After quarantine since March I’m back at university and I feel an insane amount of pressure to look good, “chic” and “in” every. single. day. I need the right jewelry, the right clothes, the right shoes - even the right backpack to “play the part”. The last couple of weeks has been extremely stressful as I’ve tried to accumulate new clothes that I like for the semester, with very little success so far.

I also feel like clothes are way too powerful when it comes to expressing who we are and building our identity - especially for women. For some, this is an advantage and cornerstone in their love of fashion. For others like me, it leads to identity-crisis, over thinking and decision-fatigue. I don’t know who I am, and I certainly don’t know how to express it through clothes, or if I even want to. Another redditor made an excellent post here about being “marked” as a woman through clothes and I felt that in my soul. I feel uncomfortable with being looked at and having to navigate what to wear and how based on my gender, and the messages implied in my clothes (in the eyes of especially men).

As a woman, I’m also completely exhausted by how quickly fashion changes and the sheer amount of options. I’m not the type who wears things that are only trendy for a short while, yet the things I wore last autumn already look a bit dated in some ways, or have been worn out due to poor quality. I simply can’t with having to buy new stuff all the time, it feels greedy, time-consuming and wasteful. Wandering around aimlessly in fluorescent light in H&M or Zara, wanting to crawl out of my skin in the dressing room as I try on yet another, ill-fitting thing as most female clothes are poorly made without regard for different body types. Even I with a very ““standard”” body struggle with odd fits all the time, I can only imagine how others feel. At the same time, my boyfriend lives happily in the same nice pants, shirts and denims season after season.

Also, these items are only timeless from a very specific, eurocentric point of view, so while I can only appreciate the help and ease it brings others to rely on these basics, it’s not the solution for everyone.

H&M,"I hear you so clearly. I have a terrible balance between comfortable/responsible and trying to maintain the social norms. I would buy something at Target, H&M, or whatever, and usually still feel like crap because I knew the quality wasn't there, or it was probably sewn by an underpaid seamstress, or because I was buying it because it was ""in"". And I absolutely hate it when I hear celebrities like Kendall Jenner say she never wears the same outfit twice. No one can live up to that expectation.

Here is what I have done, so take it with a grain of salt (I'm still a work in progress):

* I know you mentioned just buy the classics already, but this has worked for me a bit. But I define my classics based on the silhouettes that look good on me. I don't like prints too much, so solid colors are typically my go to. I embellish an outfit with accessories if I want to add a change.
* I buy second hand a lot now. I have had amazing outfits and realized that I was dressed entirely in second hand. Thred Up, Good Will, Habitat for Humanity shops. Yes there is a ton of crap so you have to be discerning, but I have found real gems.
* I pay a lot more attention to the fabric of my clothes. No more cheap polyester. Yes it has a place in this world, but it's just not for me anymore. I still love rayon, but that's about as far as I'll go. Otherwise it's cotton, linen, or silk if I can help it.
* I started sewing my own clothes. It may be extreme for some people, but I fell in love with it. The learning curve is steep, so you can get good at it quickly. You will make crap at first, but after a few garments, you can get the hang of it. The first time I made a classic white linen top, I never felt so good in a shirt. It was mine, made by me, and it fit me.
* I repeat outfits a lot. Who freaking cares if I wore the same thing last week, or last Monday for that matter. I have a linen blazer that I adore (from Old Navy) and I wear it a few times a week sometimes. I find that most of the judgement is mostly my internal voice being an ass-hole and people don't actually care what you wear. If it's good quality and looks good, wear it out.

Good luck, sister. I wish you all the best.",0.1391256313131313,0.44409722222222237,positive

H&M,"Clothes def stress me out too sometimes. I don’t feel like I have a good idea of what I look like body wise and size wise, and I often feel like I’m wearing clothes that are too big or too small. 

What’s really helped me is Pinterest tbh. I enjoy curating the different boards, especially my clothing one. I usually go through my home page just saving outfits I think look cute, the specific aesthetics don’t matter to me it’s just what’s cute, and then I can look through my whole board and notice specific things I like. I’ve realized the cuts, colors, and types of clothing I prefer through this process.

I also find that most larger retail websites have a ‘find my size’ option, where you can input info about yourself and your clothing that fits best. I recently got some stuff from H&M and everything fit perfect. I’ve spent years thinking I was a medium, yet the size xs pair of jeans I just got fit perfect.

Why not put it up when both pieces are in??

H&M,"It's funny, I never thought of myself as having a uniform per se, but after reading your comment I've realized that I do this to some extent too. The crux of it is purchasing and wearing pieces that I know I like and feel good in - not chasing trends or buying into fast fashion. I know that I like, for example, roomy shift dresses and cashmere pullover sweaters, so I keep an eye out for those items in sales, thrift stores and estate sales, and on eBay. I do end up having a lot of similar silhouettes and fabrics in my closet, but with enough variety in color/pattern and texture to still keep things interesting.

Every once in a while I'll experiment with a new trend if it appeals to me, and possibly incorporate it into my wardrobe if I'm into it, but I can't recall the last time I went into an H&M (or even a Nordstrom) to update my wardrobe.

If you’re in the UK- I’d say you can get something better from Arket or and other stories which are all fairly reasonable and don’t tend to be *as* trendy all the time.

Peek & Cloppenberg

Armed Angels is an ethical brand with decent prices. You can find this brand in stores, usually smaller. 

IKKS is French, but they have stores in places like Prenzlauer Berg in Berlin. In fact, if you're in Berlin, just head to the Weinmeisterstrasse UBahn and wander around. 

COS is another H&M brand, but unlike even designer brands, they use a lot of natural fibres. 

SuiStudio will be opening in Frankfurt. Suits and workwear, in wool, silk, linen, and some man-made fibres. 

For denim: Mavi, Nudie Jeans, Kings of Indigo, Scotch and Soda. 

Until Brexit, and with the pound so low, you can take advantage of being close to the UK. For the price of a polyester-mix designer abomination, you can get a tweed jacket from Walker Slater. Hawes & Curtis (brick and mortar store in Cologne), T.M. Lewin, and the rest of the Jermyn Street brands have a lot of German customers and the shipping is either free with a promotion or reasonable.

I do feel quite intimidated walking into shops supposedly aimed at younger women/teens.

Amour Vert just sent me a catalogue (a real paper one!) and I agree that a lot of their stuff seems aimed a slightly older demographic. Banana Republic also seems increasingly that way. Places like Chico's or Eileen Fisher obviously appeal to older women, but I own an absolutely lovely Chico's turtleneck that is a staple of my autumn wardrobe.

It can be quite fun to go into shops that are *clearly* targeted at a different age group. ""Young"" shops often have surprisingly decent basics, cotton denim and interesting skirts. (The men's section in H&M can be a goldmine.) And ""older"" shops tend to have nicer knitwear and shirting, if you can dig through all the overly boxy or flowy stuff.

Places like Garage, Urban Planet, and VS/PINK are seen as places geared more towards high schoolers. Forever 21 is debatable because I do know plenty of people my age who shop there, but I kind of grew out of their clothes. However, I do like their accessories and occasionally find some rare gems (such as a pair of high wasted pinstripe trousers that not only are suitable for smart casual workplaces, but are also honestly comfortable AF).

Most of my wardrobe consists of things from H&M and Zara for now, since they have great pieces that can transition between work and casual spaces. I do however own a few pieces from Gap, Urban Outfitters, Dynamite and Call It Spring/ALDO, in addition to random bits that were either thrifted or my parent's hand me downs from the 90s.",0.16184523809523807,0.5658829365079365,positive
Zara,"29, live in France. I go to school( masters) and work for context. Live a pretty casual lifestyle but need to be able to transition through the day from school to work to evening so my style is smart casual. I've been dressing like this since I was 22 though so I'm glad of glad to be soon entering my 30s and feel like I dress for my age as opposed to dressing more mature to counteract the babyface (still have it though). I mainly thrift and end up paying max Zara, Mango prices before sales. 

What's actually in wardrobe: Uniqlo/Madewell/J.Crew(very little of the two former brands because it needs to be picked up when I go visit family in the US)/APC (thrifted) for basics, Isabel Marant(thrifted) for structured jacket pieces. I'm a snob about shoes so will spend (okay, mainly thrift but it's not cheap) for comfortable (brand new, or worn once or twice) shoes: Pretty Ballerinas, Lanvin, Salvatore Ferragamos, What For, Isabel Marant, Mellow Yellow etc...

I do shop at Zara and Mango, but it's been increasingly difficult to find things that meet my standards for fit and quality.

I do feel quite intimidated walking into shops supposedly aimed at younger women/teens. Walking into Forever 21, H&M and Urban Outfitters makes me feel ancient, but I've had better luck online - UO in particular has good jeans. Amour Vert just sent me a catalogue (a real paper one!) and I agree that a lot of their stuff seems aimed a slightly older demographic. Banana Republic also seems increasingly that way. Places like Chico's or Eileen Fisher obviously appeal to older women, but I own an absolutely lovely Chico's turtleneck that is a staple of my autumn wardrobe.

It can be quite fun to go into shops that are *clearly* targeted at a different age group. ""Young"" shops often have surprisingly decent basics, cotton denim and interesting skirts. (The men's section in H&M can be a goldmine.) And ""older"" shops tend to have nicer knitwear and shirting, if you can dig through all the overly boxy or flowy stuff.

I don't have a girly body, and a lot of fast fashion brands are made for smaller hips, smaller boobs, no butt. 

I figured this out when I lost a lot of weight, and I still couldn't fit a lot of clothes, but it was super clear it was just because I'm tall, not too big. 

So I stay away from trendy stuff, because current trends are for small proportioned, shorter people. 

The problem you're having is that F21 and H&M are casual or club clothes, and Theory and Equipment are more business and nicer clothes. You're comparing apples to oranges. 

So the question is, what clothes are you missing from your wardrobe? Work clothes, casual, going out, etc? 

You won't find everything in one brand. I wear all American Eagle jeans because they have Long and Extra Long sizes. But I would never wear one of their tops or dresses.

Now I shop at Madewell, Loft, J Crew Factory, H&M for work (mainly due to this sub) and Levis!.  Im a manager so im aiming for higher quality pieces and office basics but also trying to throw in fun patterns.

I also attend alternative type festivals that risque wear is the norm and recently did a big shop at Dollskill and I Heart Raves ( I dont know how these will fit yet).

I also like kitty ears and my boyfriend is bald and he looks fucking fantastic with ear headbands so im on a search for more of those for this summer for both of us.

I personally think, though, that age appropriate really depends on where you live. It might be weird for me to wear knee high socks in Canada, where I'm from, because it reminds me of school uniforms, but in Japan, where I currently live, I've done it and no one bats an eye. Same with Disney merch, hair barrettes, Mary Janes, and lace bobby socks - it's acceptable even out here in the Japanese boonies to wear that kind of stuff beyond high school, and as long as you're styling it well and modestly, people do not care.",0.1406256109481916,0.49317204301075285,positive
H&M,"I'm also 28, and I think my biggest fashion shift due to my age is staying away from fast fashion, and being a more informed consumer.

I have very few options in our mall, not only because I'm in that in-between stage with fashion as well, but also because I'm a chubby petite woman. For example, most cropped shirts and pants are the right length for me. I'm also a true pear shape, so button up clothing is out of the question.

I mostly shop at H&M, Goodwill or other thrift stores, Old Navy (in-store and online - although their petite stuff is only online and is hit or miss in terms of length), and Bluenotes (I get all my jeans/jeggings here). 

I also feel too old in Forever 21 most of the time; I restrict my shopping at F21 to the basic section now because it's less confusing to me lol

I still don't have my wardrobe where I'd like it to be, but what helped me the most was trying to hone in on a theme with my clothes. For me that was keeping things to a certain colour scheme or simple classic patterns. Kind of like a capsule wardrobe, if you're familiar (if you're not, look into it! It's a super streamlined closet experience!). I'm not quite at that level yet, but so far it's been a lot easier getting ready because everything I own matches with almost everything else!

Forever 21 is debatable because I do know plenty of people my age who shop there, but I kind of grew out of their clothes.

I heard someone say somewhere that “if you wore trends the first time around, you should t be wearing them for the 2nd time”.

Example: clothing with the Theory and Equipment aesthetics feel right for work, and I'll occasionally pop into H&M or Uniqlo; but I don't feel like I've aged into Amour Vert looks yet, and I feel appx. 1000 years old when I go into F21.

I mostly wear Loft, Gap, and Target with a few others smattered in there.

My clothing choices have transitioned over the past few years partly because I'm getting older and have a different opinion on what looks 'good' to me and partly because my body is changing (having kids, etc). 

As I get older, I'm trying to pick more 'timeless' pieces and to trying really understand my personal style. It's less about what's *appropriate* for my age, and more about what I personally love wearing - what I feel **confident** in. I feel confident in high-necked swing tanks because it doesn't cling to my now-squishy mid-section and covers up my chest that sometimes has acne. I might feel differently about crop tops if I still had the body I had when I was 21!

I like the Sezane aesthetic, though I haven't been able to justify the price yet, and I like & Other Stories, Madewell and Massimo Dutti. I buy basics from Gap, J. Crew and occasionally Everlane. I do shop at Zara and Mango, but it's been increasingly difficult to find things that meet my standards for fit and quality.

I do feel quite intimidated walking into shops supposedly aimed at younger women/teens. Walking into Forever 21, H&M and Urban Outfitters makes me feel ancient, but I've had better luck online - UO in particular has good jeans. Amour Vert just sent me a catalogue (a real paper one!) and I agree that a lot of their stuff seems aimed a slightly older demographic. Banana Republic also seems increasingly that way. Places like Chico's or Eileen Fisher obviously appeal to older women, but I own an absolutely lovely Chico's turtleneck that is a staple of my autumn wardrobe.

It can be quite fun to go into shops that are *clearly* targeted at a different age group. ""Young"" shops often have surprisingly decent basics, cotton denim and interesting skirts. (The men's section in H&M can be a goldmine.) And ""older"" shops tend to have nicer knitwear and shirting, if you can dig through all the overly boxy or flowy stuff. Sometimes the jewellery is great too. My favourite source for accessories, aside from vintage shops, is art museum and orchestra gift shops. However, it seems impossible to find trousers I like at shops aimed at women over 35 - everything is either too low-waisted or too wide-legged.",0.1700617283950617,0.470679012345679,positive

Madewell,"This is actually something I think about often because I'm pretty unhappy with my work wardrobe and feel like I'm only ""myself"" when I dress casual and on the weekends. I'm 25, but work in a fairly conservative office setting where the dress is almost anti-trendy and most of my coworkers are twice my age. There's nothing wrong with the age difference, but it's more noticeable by what they wear. It's very corporate-looking, with work pants and blouses. Lots of LOFT and Express, but not necessarily the new stuff - more older season styles that still feel classic. I find myself in a rut of wearing a solid dark color work pant and a floral blouse from LOFT just to feel normal at work. I don't hate it, but it's not very inspirational! I'll thrift a lot of other simple cardigans and sweaters for work, not usually paying attention to the brand.

&#x200B;

Casually, my personal style comes to life. I wear a lot of Madewell, Patagonia, PrAna, Everlane, Free People, Teva sandals, and various other outdoorsy brands mixed with capsule/basic type pieces that (I try to) elevate from just technical apparel to ""I can hike in this, and go to dinner, and also go to a bar all in one go.""

Based on my lifestyle, a lot of seemingly younger, trendy pieces still feel age appropriate when I go to concerts and spend time biking around town. I still feel like a college-student age sometimes, and have no problem wearing crop tops and overalls, or a plunging neckline for a tank as long as I don't overdo it for myself personally.

Now I shop at Madewell, Loft, J Crew Factory, H&M for work (mainly due to this sub) and Levis!.  Im a manager so im aiming for higher quality pieces and office basics but also trying to throw in fun patterns.

I also attend alternative type festivals that risque wear is the norm and recently did a big shop at Dollskill and I Heart Raves ( I dont know how these will fit yet). Im leaning toward ""Punk, witch, Kawaii"" and I can pull off crop tops now so Im trying to get up on that hype!

Im almost embarrassed to even write that but I have a few looks that include socks with frilly cuffs. I also like kitty ears and my boyfriend is bald and he looks fucking fantastic with ear headbands so im on a search for more of those for this summer for both of us.

So basically this will be launched around Sept 19-22 in online and stores (dates will differ depending on country), and the launch is worldwide! I'm so happy. Even though I live in a hot country in Asia, people here still do travel and often to colder climates, so I'm glad we're going to be getting a taste of this lovely collection.

I'm especially excited for the military sweaters and oversized turtlenecks. The ruffle blouses look neat, but not sure how I would style them for the office. The heavier coats in the collection might not make it to some countries. They've done this before with other collections.

But the big american retailers seem to having trouble. I was reading another article about another american retailer on trouble, JCrew, and it had some very interesting points. i wish could find the article again. Other companies like Inditex (Zara) or Fast retailing (Uniqlo) or HM parent company whose name is eluding me, or even Mango or Benetton do not seem to be in so much trouble. or Primark/Penneys!

>A pretty core reason this happens is that American shoppers (particularly women) often ""value shop,"" (i.e. buy something because it's a good deal) whereas European shoppers tend to shop more seasonally (buy spring clothes at the beginning of spring), with less regard to whether it's cheap.

I am not sure I agree. Europe and America are huge markets, and I assure you a lot of european women, and a lot are very price conscious and value shop a lot indeed - consider the sucess of Primark for example. You don´t really get discounts or even sales at Primark for example. Pick it or leave it.  Leftovers might be discounted and out in a bin, at their own leisure if they want to. I think the way people shop, either beginning of the season to get a lot of wear for trends, or bargain buying at sales, often has more to do with the personality and lifestyle of the person rather than nationality.

>I am American, and I'm aware that it's quite popular to shit on our shopping habits,

I didn´t mean to. I meant to criticize the GAP´s marketing habits which I find personally very offputting and  I was just speculating if that might not be a source of their troubles. No criticism intended at american shoppers, just a particular type of marketing strategy.

>but personally I think ""value shopping,"" if you have a good eye for quality and design, ends up costing drastically less

sure, I am a very price conscious shopper. But the gap´s constant discounts, and the way they vary those is just very frustratring to me. If they price their shirts at 40 euros, and Uniqlo and benetton is pricing theirs at 30, and Zara and HM have their shirts at 26 or 20 euros, maybe the Gap is planning to sell most of their shirts with special 30% discounts and that shirt is going to cost 28 euros after all or 32 or 26, and as such it might not be much more expensive. But the label price still looks higher, even if the quality is not so apparent, and to me it´s just frustratring to keep track of all the discounts. That shirt is not going to be a better shirt just because they put it a higher price counting on discounting it lots all the time.

Nevermind, and because I love value shopping, how awful it is to buy something with say a 25% discount and then next week, special promo and it´s 30% discount or something. When Gap is offering a discount, i still do not feel much urgency because odds are another discount is coming when that finishes and it might be better. i am only moved to actually buy when somehting is 50% or more discounted - and that is not sustainable for them. new shoppers who are not into their discounting habits might look at original price and ignore the brand forever after.

H&M,"I guess it all just depends on people being ok with spending more money on clothes. I think the appeal of these fast fashion stores is that they have so much product and get new, trendy things in everyday, whereas (I'm assuming because I only browse there every once in a while) GAP has a lot more staple pieces and has a somewhat set aesthetic. It doesn't really look like it's trying to be super trendy. Personally I actually really like the GAP and if I had more money I probably would have shopped there more often. 

I used to work for Jacob, which is a Canadian retail company that recently went out of business. It had mid-range pricing relative to most stores. I think it had similar issues to the GAP in that it presented fairly basic clothes of mediocre/wide range of quality at higher prices. I remember purchasing a plain grey cardigan from there (with my discount thank god) that was originally $70. I am pretty particular with washing instructions and it still ended up with holes in the armpits after 2 washes. Anyone could have scooped up a cardigan from H&M of similar quality for a quarter of the price. Anyway, even with amazing customer service out store which was in the larger mall in the province would struggle to make $3,000 on a weekend. 

This all being said, working for H&M was probably the best retail experience I had. I suspect this is because it's a Swedish company and up until very recently I feel like that was very much a part of its identity here in Canada (not very hierarchical, European customer service, good benefits for full-time employees and management and paid vacation, etc). The thing that killed it for me was the crazy customers I had to deal with day in and day out. ",0.20366883116883117,0.4519913419913421,positive
Uniqlo,"Gap is just a very baffling company to me. They expanded to Europe, and they are probably the only clothing company operating in Europe with cheap shipping and frequent free shipping discounts. But their pricing is pretty high compared to what I can buy elsewhere, and the discounts and sales all the time quite frankly are baffling, if I buy something with 25% discount in two days it will be 30% or something. I was receiving their newsletters but they were sending like 3 a week or more, all big letters and discounts and all, so offputting, I just unsubscribed from all. And maybe this is a cultural bias, but I kind of like the big sales season twice a year, you know when to go looking for things, you understand that, when things go on sale all randomly, I do loose interest.

But their pricing is pretty high compared to what I can buy elsewhere, and the discounts and sales all the time quite frankly are baffling, if I buy something with 25% discount in two days it will be 30% or something. I was receiving their newsletters but they were sending like 3 a week or more, all big letters and discounts and all, so offputting, I just unsubscribed from all. And maybe this is a cultural bias, but I kind of like the big sales season twice a year, you know when to go looking for things, you understand that, when things go on sale all randomly, I do loose interest.

I think the appeal of these fast fashion stores is that they have so much product and get new, trendy things in everyday, whereas (I'm assuming because I only browse there every once in a while) GAP has a lot more staple pieces and has a somewhat set aesthetic. It doesn't really look like it's trying to be super trendy. Personally I actually really like the GAP and if I had more money I probably would have shopped there more often. 

I used to work for Jacob, which is a Canadian retail company that recently went out of business. It had mid-range pricing relative to most stores. I think it had similar issues to the GAP in that it presented fairly basic clothes of mediocre/wide range of quality at higher prices. I remember purchasing a plain grey cardigan from there (with my discount thank god) that was originally $70. I am pretty particular with washing instructions and it still ended up with holes in the armpits after 2 washes. Anyone could have scooped up a cardigan from H&M of similar quality for a quarter of the price. Anyway, even with amazing customer service out store which was in the larger mall in the province would struggle to make $3,000 on a weekend. 

This all being said, working for H&M was probably the best retail experience I had. I suspect this is because it's a Swedish company and up until very recently I feel like that was very much a part of its identity here in Canada (not very hierarchical, European customer service, good benefits for full-time employees and management and paid vacation, etc). The thing that killed it for me was the crazy customers I had to deal with day in and day out. ",0.20366883116883117,0.4519913419913421,positive

>A pretty core reason this happens is that American shoppers (particularly women) often ""value shop,"" (i.e. buy something because it's a good deal) whereas European shoppers tend to shop more seasonally (buy spring clothes at the beginning of spring), with less regard to whether it's cheap.

I am not sure I agree. Europe and America are huge markets, and I assure you a lot of european women, and a lot are very price conscious and value shop a lot indeed - consider the sucess of Primark for example. You don´t really get discounts or even sales at Primark for example. Pick it or leave it.  Leftovers might be discounted and out in a bin, at their own leisure if they want to. I think the way people shop, either beginning of the season to get a lot of wear for trends, or bargain buying at sales, often has more to do with the personality and lifestyle of the person rather than nationality.

>I am American, and I'm aware that it's quite popular to shit on our shopping habits,

I didn´t mean to. I meant to criticize the GAP´s marketing habits which I find personally very offputting and  I was just speculating if that might not be a source of their troubles. No criticism intended at american shoppers, just a particular type of marketing strategy.

>but personally I think ""value shopping,"" if you have a good eye for quality and design, ends up costing drastically less

sure, I am a very price conscious shopper. But the gap´s constant discounts, and the way they vary those is just very frustratring to me. If they price their shirts at 40 euros, and Uniqlo and benetton is pricing theirs at 30, and Zara and HM have their shirts at 26 or 20 euros, maybe the Gap is planning to sell most of their shirts with special 30% discounts and that shirt is going to cost 28 euros after all or 32 or 26, and as such it might not be much more expensive. But the label price still looks higher, even if the quality is not so apparent, and to me it´s just frustratring to keep track of all the discounts. That shirt is not going to be a better shirt just because they put it a higher price counting on discounting it lots all the time.

Nevermind, and because I love value shopping, how awful it is to buy something with say a 25% discount and then next week, special promo and it´s 30% discount or something. When Gap is offering a discount, i still do not feel much urgency because odds are another discount is coming when that finishes and it might be better. i am only moved to actually buy when somehting is 50% or more discounted - and that is not sustainable for them. new shoppers who are not into their discounting habits might look at original price and ignore the brand forever after.

I like women's clothes and when I used to go thrifting a lot I would try women's stuff on all the time. I just tried on some coats at Madewell the other day with my girlfriend and it brought back memories of trying women's coats at thrift stores. 

Unfortunately, the arms are always too short and usually there are other fit issues that are not necessarily immediately apparent. For me, things tend to be too tight in the shoulders (particularly when it has a high arm hole). Even with raglan type sleeves. This is frequently the case for me with clothes designed for men too, so finding women's stuff that works is rare.

So, I will dismiss things without trying because I can usually tell by looking if the sleeves are short or if the shoulder is too narrow. 

But your main point is that there's a double standard, and I'm guilty of dismissing things for that reason too. I don't feel like rocking the boat because with poor fit, I don't have the confidence. (The same of course is true if I'm wearing men's clothes that don't fit.) 

I am actually currently trying to transition to less masculine clothing because I can do it without much friction in most settings where I spend my days, and I realized recently after buying an expensive button up shirt that I really liked... that I don't actually like button up shirts as a concept in general (I returned the shirt).

I've been online window shopping at Uniqlo for a while, and the general consensus from searching this subreddit seems to be that they have some pretty good basics. They haven't opened store here in Australia yet, but when they do, I was planning on doing a bit of shopping. (Or maybe using a shopping service if I *really* can't wait!)

I have a few questions for anyone that's bought things from there, though.
Firstly, how do you find the knits/cashmere/merino sweaters and cardigans? Do they pill easily? How is the quality?

Secondly, I run an Australian 14-16, depending upon store. (Though with my diet and exercise I hope to be less than that soon!) That's about a USA 10/12, and I'm 5'7'', has anyone close to this sizing bought anything there, and how did it work for you? I worry it might cater to smaller/taller people.

Uniqlo,"I went to the Uniqlo in NYC and was super unimpressed. I only found one or two things I liked, nothing fit (and I was towards the end of my grossly thin phase), and was underwhelmed by the quality. I don't understand why it gets recommended around here because I still don't think it has that big of a brick and mortar prescience in the US (and I don't think it's worth the hassle of ordering online and returning). This was maybe 5 years ago, though, so it may have gotten a lot better since then. Or it's not that great, but the best you'll get for the price.

Since you're currently towards the upper end of their size range, I would encourage you to wait until you can go to a store and try things on - Uniqlo may work for you, but I don't think it's worth the gamble and hassle of paying a fortune to ship it to Australia.

the closest uniqlo from your location would be in Jakarta, Indonesia.

also their anti UV jacket is awesome, it's 30+ deg Celcius here the past couple of months, I am thankful they have this.

on sizing, they do not have a standard one, therefore, you must try on the store. you can ask for alteration or you can return them in 30 days.

I was shocked!!! The standard CLUB attire …. Baggy or mom Jeans , crop top and platform sneakers.  Or spanx looking anything - nude body suit , nude cotton dress that looks like a slip, biker shorts with a matching sports bra and a short square toe heel or platform sneakers …. At a popular club 😱 

Here I was super overdressed in my simple black bandage dress and studded Valentino 4” heels. I spend most of my days in sweats so I was feeling myself and looking sexy as heck. 

Then we got there and amidst the sea of denim, spanx and sneakers …and I felt like an escort for millionaires and … maybe a Milf.  However, I was on 🔥that night and got hit on like crazy - I suspect because they thought I was a madam, an escort or maybe because I stuck out like a sore thumb amidst the sea of baggy denim and sneakers!!!!

I remember my college days of express/forever 21 sexy outfits and dancing to Britney, Lil Jon, R Kelly’s ignition or Bump and grind at 2am. 

These club days (at least in Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta & DC where I’ve gone in the past year…bachelorette parties) are NOT the amazing club days where we used to go ALL out during a girls night. It makes me sad lol

As for Stores - Zara has been my balance. These are in my cart right now. Easy to dress up or dress down with sneakers like these new clubbers 🤣

But , brands are not going to put out cotton sweaters in October. cotton is a louzy material when it is cold and wet, that is winter. It can be kind of chilly, it becomes a bad insulator when wet. Brands make cotton sweaters for spring and summer, that is when you find 100% cotton sweaters. That being said, there are some surprisingly nice 100% cotton crew neck striped sweaters at zara (they call them tshirts though). Benetton has lots of 100% cotton knits, though not sure they have them in stock now, in autumn/winter.

As an alternative to cashmere, have you tried merino? It is basically machine washable (buy slightly oversize and risk it in any case), not as suffocating warm as cashmere, naturally stretchy.

H&M,"So. First off I absolutely know this is not advised, and trust me I wish I wasn't at this point :)

I've gained enough weight that my clothes just don't fit. At all. But I've spent the past year doing the whole ""when I lose weight, THEN I'll buy new clothes"" game. I've been wearing sweatpants and oversized hoodies literally everywhere. I skipped events over the holidays because I had nothing to wear. I'm about to go back to school, and reailze that enough is enough. I feel like I'm MORE depressed and unmotivated now because I literally can't get dressed out of PJs.

Which brings me to my current situation. I want to spend as LITTLE money as possible putting together a little mini wardrobe that I can wear RIGHT NOW, but I'm not sure the best way to go about this. I really don't want to invest in expensive pieces that wouldn't fit in the future, because for health reasons I do NEED to lose weight. I also will go against the grain here and say that thrift shopping does NOT work for me for many reasons, so that's not an option.

Has anyone been through this before? Any advice where to go, what to focus on, etc? I was considering H&M, TJ Maxx... anywhere I can find a wide variety for fairly cheap, but I'm open to (and grateful for!) ALL suggestions.

H&M,"Hi there, just a few questions about your lifestyle (if you are going to have a small wardrobe lifestyle is key). You said you go to school, so I assume you are looking for more casual pieces?  Will you be planning on going to a job, any interviews? Are you on your feet a lot, walking to places etc? What is the weather like in your area (do you have 4 seasons)?

I'm going to go with the assumption that you want something a little more casual. So here are my suggestions:

**Tops** 

T-shirts: Grab 2-3 (black, white and a colour you like), these can be mixed and matched with a variety of outfits. Old Navy and Gap do good classic t-shirts

Tank tops: Grab 1-2 (a neutral and a colour that you like), these can be layered under a cardigan or shirt. Again Gap or Old Navy have basic tanks

Blouse: Depending on your style preferences/lifestyle, a nicer blouse is good to have for an occasion to dress up, like a presentation or a job interview. Something like [this](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.1114372002.html) from H&M looks good tucked into pants or jeans, and adds a bit more interest

Sweater: A basic crew neck sweater (cotton or wool depending on the temps) again can be mixed and matched. I like [this](https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=513521012&cid=5745&pcid=5745&vid=1&nav=meganav%3AWomen%3ACategories%3ASweaters+&cpos=6&cexp=2859&kcid=CategoryIDs%3D5745&cvar=25416&ctype=Listing&cpid=res2301031053112640535977#pdp-page-content) one from GAP (always goes on sale) 

Button-down shirt: Buying an oversized fit in a thicker material means you can wear it buttoned up or down, even as a light jacket. There are tons floating around but I like [this](https://www.ae.com/ca/en/p/aerie/tops/shirts-blouses/aerie-lumberjane-waffle-shirt/1783_2898_294?menu=cat4840006) one from Aerie. 

Cardigan: Great to throw on over a tank-top, can also work with any weight fluctuations. Old Navy has a ton of them in different styles and length like [this](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=671715162&cid=20408&pcid=20408&vid=1&nav=meganav%3AWomen%3AShop%20Women%27s%20Categories%3ASweaters%20&cpos=51&cexp=2223&kcid=CategoryIDs%3D20408&cvar=16849&ctype=Listing&cpid=res23010310939089293097653#pdp-page-content) one. 

**Bottoms**

Jeans: Get 2 pairs of straight leg jeans in a dark and lighter wash. Try to avoid jeans with a ton of distressing, since they can show wear quicker (given you have a small wardrobe you are going to wear things out quicker). Old Navy or American Eagle will probably give you the most bang for your buck. 

Pants: Get a pair of black straight-leg pants. These are good for dressing up (e.g. with a blouse) and are versatile with all your tops. [These](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=477460002&cid=85729&pcid=85729&vid=1&nav=meganav%3AWomen%3AShop%20Women%27s%20Categories%3AJeans%20&cpos=13&cexp=2223&kcid=CategoryIDs%3D85729&cvar=16849&ctype=Listing&cpid=res23010310460628726268479&ccam=17917#pdp-page-content) from Old Navy could work, or you could do [these](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E450606-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=004) from Uniqlo (a little more dressier)

Misc/bonus item(s): Again I don't know your style or lifestyle, but one more bottom would be good to round out the wardrobe. You could consider a skirt or another pair of pants. If you want a skirt, a basic midi works great with the tops, looks good dressed down with sneakers etc. I like [this](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E456442-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=004) one from Uniqlo, because it can be dressed casually and has an elasticized waist. If you aren't a skirt person, maybe consider a pair of flowy wide-leg pants or cargo pants, just to mix it up but it still goes with all your tops.

&#x200B;

So overall that gives you around 12 pieces of clothing to start with (not including shoes, accessories or outerwear). Hope that helps!",0.1467494089834515,0.42523640661938533,positive
H&M,"Since I mostly wear dresses, I'd probably focus on buying dresses that don't need to fit exactly. For example, dresses with a fuller skirt and elasticated smocking, dresses that are meant to be belted and otherwise loose (e.g. shirt dresses). That way if my weight were to change, the same clothes would still look fine for quite a while, and of course they allow for normal weight fluctuation too. Also, wearing bike shorts + dress feels basically the same as bike shorts and a t-shirt if the dress is comfortable and it still allows for a lot of activity with no chafing, and leggings or wool tights are an option if it's cold. 

If you want to be more comfortable or just don't feel up to a ""real outfit,"" switching the sweatpants and oversize hoodie for leggings and an oversize sweater is basically the same thing but it will look nicer and maybe boost your mood on days when you just need to wear loungewear. Not sure what your size is but Aerie is pretty affordable on sale for leggings (I love the offline flare leggings) and I've gotten some decent sweaters at (in order of least to most expensive) H&M, Uniqlo, and J.Crew on sale. Again, if the sweater is meant to be oversize, the only pieces you'd have to switch out periodically if your weight changes are the leggings.",0.1321095571095571,0.5499902874902873,positive
H&M,"I changed 3 sizes over the course of two years so I’ve been there! I basically bought everything in black (besides jeans) because it all looked good together and cohesive. I also largely stuck with an athleisure wardrobe because I live in a place with 4 seasons and people dress very casually so I can layer when needed. Plus, the stretch in the fabric helps with fluctuating bodies. 

- American Eagle for jeans because they have great curvy fits 
- Leggings (Target, Eddie Bauer, and Vitality)
- Tops both casual and nicer (Target, F21, H&M, Kohls) 
-New underwear and bralettes (target, kohls)
- Zip up jackets/pull overs (Target/Poshmark)
- Jumpsuits (initial one was from Target and I wore it so much and eventually grew out of it so I splurged and bought one from Patagonia)

I also ended up splurging on a nice new winter jacket which is needed where I live.",0.12450525664811377,0.513404452690167,positive
H&M,"I like the Old Navy or H&M advice. It will be easier to find a go-together feel at one store.
I actually think this would be fun. 
Shop like you lost your suitcase. 
Jeans, pants, cute tops, sweaters, a dress, a skirt AND some cute workout wear so you can get to the size you want!",0.305,0.5,positive
H&M,"First I would do a bit of analysing; what's my lifestyle? How do I want to feel? What are my colours?

To find the colours that are flattering on you, you can do a colour analysis test like [this](https://thelaurieloo.com/blog/what-season-am-i). If you want more information on what it is, I think [this](https://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/color-analysis-which-color-season-are-you) one explains it well. This is especially useful for tops, the wrong colour can make you look sickly, when the right one will make you look even more fabulous than you already are.

You can go for all neutrals and basics, but that's not how I roll. Having a few basic pieces are great though. IMO you can look 'put together' with cheap tops, but with more quality in pants and accessories like bags and jewelry.

Black pants work with a lot of occasions. It could be jeans or dressier pants. I like to go for ""casual dress pants"", it looks posh but feels like you're wearing yoga/sweatpants, in a good way. With black pants I feel like it isn't as obvious when you wear it all the time than other colours. I once read from a stylist that you have to look at the outer ring of your iris to find your dark colour. For example mine are green. Dark green looks better on me than black.

I don't know in what climate you live so I'm going for a bit of everything. Summertops and tshirts can double as undershirts in winter. You can wear fleece leggings under flowier pants or dresses. A bit oversized dresses are great; you can cinch it with a belt according to your figure at the time. I love patterns, makes the outfit less basic. For sweaters I like to look for a bit fitted ones (not too much, but not oversized) with balloon sleeves or batwing sleeves. It makes my outfits a bit more interesting. You can get clothes for cheap without it looking cheap, some cheap materials can look higher end.

As for the stores. I only have experience with H&M. I go to more local chains/shops, sometimes they have great sales: once I got a very nice sweater for €2. Some other shops (homeware shops, pharmacy's, dollar stores etc.) also sell clothing for a good price.

Sorry for all the rambling haha. Basically look for the right colours and better looking fabrics. Personally if I had to make a mini wardrobe I'd go for: black jeans, black flared yoga leggings, a green sweater, a fun sweater, a dress with a pattern appropriate for formal events and summer, animal printed tops,  a top with some beading, glitter or a shine to it. I'd go for tops with less basic straps, tshirt with oversided sleeves or a different neckline.

Jeans: Get 2 pairs of straight leg jeans in a dark and lighter wash. Try to avoid jeans with a ton of distressing, since they can show wear quicker (given you have a small wardrobe you are going to wear things out quicker).

Misc/bonus item(s): Again I don't know your style or lifestyle, but one more bottom would be good to round out the wardrobe. You could consider a skirt or another pair of pants. If you want a skirt, a basic midi works great with the tops, looks good dressed down with sneakers etc. I like [this](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E456442-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=004) one from Uniqlo, because it can be dressed casually and has an elasticized waist.

Uniqlo,"Since I mostly wear dresses, I'd probably focus on buying dresses that don't need to fit exactly. For example, dresses with a fuller skirt and elasticated smocking, dresses that are meant to be belted and otherwise loose (e.g. shirt dresses). That way if my weight were to change, the same clothes would still look fine for quite a while, and of course they allow for normal weight fluctuation too. Also, wearing bike shorts + dress feels basically the same as bike shorts and a t-shirt if the dress is comfortable and it still allows for a lot of activity with no chafing, and leggings or wool tights are an option if it's cold. 

If you want to be more comfortable or just don't feel up to a ""real outfit,"" switching the sweatpants and oversize hoodie for leggings and an oversize sweater is basically the same thing but it will look nicer and maybe boost your mood on days when you just need to wear loungewear.

I'm going to go with the assumption that you want something a little more casual. So here are my suggestions:

**Tops** 

T-shirts: Grab 2-3 (black, white and a colour you like), these can be mixed and matched with a variety of outfits. Old Navy and Gap do good classic t-shirts

The style is sort of similar, although perhaps not as boho/whimsical. There are still plenty of colours and prints, so it's not just plain basics like the article talked about as being what plus sizes have often been relegated to.

The Violeta page is mildly annoying to navigate, as you have to go through one of their 'edits' pages before just getting to all the clothes, but that's a minor quibble.

Mango/Violeta's clothes are also cheaper to buy than Anthropologie's, and the quality is not bad for a high street store.

Madewell,"I'm glad you suggested this! I'm not plus-sized, but I am on the higher end of straight sizes (12) and have trouble finding clothes that fit my waist-to-hip ratio and larger bust/arms/shoulders. Anthropologie is often a good brand for me, so it was helpful to see someone much bigger with a difficult-to-dress body shape describe what was and wasn't working with the clothes. It was kind of amazing to me actually to see how well some of the clothes fit off the rack.

I think that Anthropologie does a good job of adding details like tie waists and smocking (and whatever was going on in the puff sleeves) so that clothes fit more variety of body types while still using quality fabrics like cotton and silk as opposed to just using spandex blends.

I totally agreed with her take on the yellow swing dress, but I think her characterization of rayon is unfair. Yes, rayon is cheaper than cotton, but the quality of Anthropologie's rayon is higher than Old Navy or Forever 21. Rayon makes a great lining for silk summer dresses because it is more lightweight and breathable than adding another layer of silk. Besides you have to dry clean or hand wash silk anyway, so you don't have to worry about the rayon shrinking or disintegrating. And it's way better than the usual polyester and acetate linings that J Crew, Madewell, and Banana Republic often use (at around the same price point). Also I thought the rayon floral dress, while maybe not super exciting, fit really well. I doubt a similar dress from Old Navy would look as good. Sure the $140 price tag is questionable, but that dress will definitely go on sale later. Christy Dawn and Reformation sell rayon dresses for much higher prices that don't come in larger sizes, and sure they are ""ethical,"" but shouldn't recycled rayon be less expensive?

Yes, Anthropologie is not an ""ethical"" company. It is owned by Urban Outfitters. A lot of the clothes are overpriced. It is definitely a lifestyle brand. But as mall stores go, I think the fit and quality of Anthropologie's clothes (the ones that aren't just made to go on sale) is much higher than similar brands. I have gotten a lot of things on sale and secondhand that are good quality, fit well, and have unique designs. 

I also appreciate Glitter and Lazers starting off by saying that yeah, Anthropologie is expensive, but that's what a lot of people pay for better quality clothes. 

Sorry for the super long response. I just really appreciated this! I don't usually watch youtube hauls, but this helped me figure out some of the things to look for in garments to fit off-the-rack. ",0.17619047619047618,0.5000440917107584,positive

Zara,"[Rains wins lawsuit battle against Inditex for design infringement by Zara](https://www.theindustry.fashion/rains-wins-lawsuit-battle-against-inditex-for-design-infringement-by-zara/)

The Danish brand Rains, which specializes in making raincoats, has just won a lawsuit against Inditex, owner of Zara. The lawsuit is for design infringement for two outerwear designs. 

This battle has been going since 2016. Inditex tried to offer a settlement earlier on, but Rains turned it down on principle. Two of Inditex's factories in China have admitted to being instructed to copy Rains' designs exactly. Inditex will have to pay a compensation amount to Rains, and has been banned from marketing and selling the specified products in Denmark. Rains stated back in 2018 that they expect to go after them in different countries, once the verdict was settled in Denmark.

Daniel Brix Hesselager, one of Rains' cofounders, is hoping this will encourage other companies to take up the fight against these large fashion retailers.

What are your thoughts? Do you think this will help pave the way for others to do the same? Do you think a company like Inditex truly cares about lawsuits like this, or are they just too big to care?

 I have not been able to buy directly from H&M, Zara, AEO, A&F and the like because since ive been on lockdown I've only been watching documentaries on YouTube, and I've seen a few highlighting clothing manufacturing and dying in Asia for their companies and exactly what they are doing and how bad it is for the environment/local people. From sandblasting jeans to what dye companies are doing with chemical waste- dumping it directly into local rivers. It is making people sick and tainting their food and it's really fucking sad. Not to mention killing all life in the rivers. I suggest anyone take a look for themselves, but you won't like what you see.

Gap,"Old Navy is hit and miss for me. Most of my jeans are from there because their ""curvy"" jeans fit me everywhere. (I have a big butt and thighs but a relatively small waist, and they're one of the few ones I've found that fit comfortably with no waist gap.) And their short length is perfect for me - the cuffs don't get under my shoes *or* float just above the tops of them. I also have a few basic tees from there that I've been wearing for at least a decade, and I love their workout clothes!

But none of their nicer-looking or trendier stuff ever seems to fit me properly. Any of their more fitted tops are too tight in some areas and too loose in others. (I tried on a button-up once that looked like the buttons were going to burst in the front but was full-on billowing in the back.) Dresses are too loose on the top compared to the bottom, or vice versa, or the armholes sag down to the middle of my ribcage. And anything more blousy makes me look like I'm 5 months pregnant, which is not quite the look I'm going for, you know?

I usually end up going to Reitmans for everything else. (I'm pretty sure they're only in Canada) I used to think of them as an ""old lady"" store when I was a kid, but they've actually got some pretty cute stuff these days, and a wide range of fits so I can try on clothes from a bunch of different sections and almost always find something I like that fits me properly.",0.14395684724632093,0.4125514105777263,positive

Zara,"Hi!

I'm sorry you're experiencing frustration trying to find clothes that work for you. But I am glad you felt you could come here for help!

I'll talk about some things I have found worth it:

Jeans - You get what you pay for. Cheap jeans (Zara, H&M, Old Navy) are not a good investment. They stretch out, are thin, don't fit as well, especially if you want a jean that sculpts your derriere. Also, they are often made in poor conditions overseas (not everyone cares about that, but I do). 

Mid-range jeans are often a bit better (Gap, Levis) in terms of stretch and shape retention, but are still made in poor conditions and still aren't that great IMO.

My go-to brand of investment jeans is Citizens of Humanity, particularly for the boyfriend jean styles (I'm not a fan of their rocket skinnies, they are just too high waisted for me). They don't stretch out and lose their shape, and they have great cuts and washes. They just look like a premium jean. I also like Rag and Bone (for skinnies); again, not too much stretch, no bagging out and they retain washes well. Both companies are American and AFAIK make their jeans in the US. I have bought both brands new and through eBay (used) and have never been disappointed. If you do go used, make sure your seller is trustworthy. (If you aren't familiar with the fits of these brands I might suggest trying some on in store and then hunting down a used pair online).

For leggings I have been a long-time Lulu customer, and as much as they tick me off I'm having a really hard time finding a replacement for their leggings (in particular the Align pant, which is a great product). I have skinny legs, muscular butt and a tummy so I can be challenging to fit in a legging. I'm not a big fan of wearing leggings outside of the house or yoga studio, but I understand some people want to wear them everywhere. In my experience cheaper leggings means thinner material, loose threads or just awkward fit. Leggings from the Gap and Old Navy do not work for me. Nor do the leggings from Lulu's offshoot brand Kit and Ace. Ditto for Löle. Alo is okay, but very pricey and too trendy. Onzie's fabric drives me nuts (too shiny; I like thick, matte black leggings). 

T-shirts are so hit and miss. You can spend 30 bucks on a tee from Everlane and it gets holes in two washes. Then you'll grab a discount tee out of a bin from Old Navy and it lasts you ten years. There is little rhyme or reason. I guess my advice would be to stick to thicker cotton or linen or bamboo knits (and am not a fan of polyester and don't like it in my clothing). Thin t-shirts can feel really soft, but they're also going to get destroyed fast. T-shirts with viscose will wrinkle a lot (and look cheap) and those with polyester in them are going to be sweaty. Basically fabric composition and weight will dictate a lot about how the t-shirt will hold up over time. I find I have far more success buying cotton basics in store, because then I can at least feel how thick they are/how the hand feels/look at the stitching quality.

Lingerie is another area where I think you have to spend a bit more. It's always worth it to have a proper fitting and to invest in undergarments that make you look and feel great. It is a real confidence boost and can improve your daily comfort a lot too. You don't have to buy the fanciest french lingerie, but a well-made American bra with quality fabric might be well worth looking at. I find its also worth it to have a few different types of undergarments (ones for sport, ones for sleep, ones for everyday, ones for formal occasions and ones for period). 

When I shop I basically shop by fabric and colour as much or more than style. I stick to very classic styles and when I find something I like, I will get it in multiples (if the colours suit me...I am very picky about colour). If it is cotton, silk, linen, bamboo, merino or cashmere, I'm interested. I like my clothes to be luxurious, but in a very understated way. 

I splurge on silk scarves, shoes and handbags, coats and jewelry. They are the statement pieces of my wardrobe and can be worn again and again with no concern for my current weight/pant size. A great shoe or handbag can really elevate a pretty basic outfit to something special. And like most other things, expensive shoes and handbags are often better made and will outlast cheap trendy  ones (but you do have to put some care into taking care of them). Of course, these are things you should do plenty of research on before committing to; there's no use in splurging on a $2500 handbag that just doesn't suit your lifestyle. 

Basically, I'm the kinda person whose wardrobe is 80% black or denim. I make it interesting by adding accessories. Almost everything I own works together; I have learned that flashy but impractical pieces will just sit unworn and I will regret buying them. I'm not a minimalist by most people's standards, but I definitely have refined my look and my wardrobe over the past decade and have less items (but much higher quality) than when I started out. 

I too am not as happy shopping these days (for multiple reasons, but I hear you about the body issues). But I see it as an investment in my image that helps me do my work. My students and clients expect me to be well put-together, and it gives them confidence in me. When you look like you've got your shit together, people believe it. 

I'd go through your closet and see if you can identify areas that are lacking (perhaps ""professional clothes"" or ""going out clothes."" Try to identify which kinds of pieces you are looking for (e.g. a good blazer or a little black dress) so that once you hit the shops you are hunting with specific items in mind. Also, if you can anticipate how much use an item will get, you can more easily figure out if you should splurge or save. Coat that you will wear every year for the next decade? Splurge. Work pants that you only wear to interviews? Save. 

Welp, I guess I wrote a novel, sorry. I hope you'll be able to figure out a way to get over your shopping shyness (It sounds like you need to arm yourself with knowledge, both of the products you seek and of your own needs/lifestyle). Remember, shop for the life you live now (not the instagram fantasy), shop for the size you are now (not your goal weight) and be realistic about how much effort you are willing to put into taking care of your clothes (don't buy expensive knits if you can't be bothered to hand wash). 

And the most important thing...if you try it and you feel great in it, it makes you smile, you can't stop thinking about it after a couple of days...go buy it! Those are the serendipitous finds that make shopping so much fun.

H&M,"Hello, FFA! I'm a hardcore lurker on this sub. Like, a nine year hardcore lurker. I read, gawk, and giggle at all of your posts on the daily, and finally have a question of my own (see post title).

The short of it is: I don't shop for myself and I want to change that. I have body image issues that have rendered me nearly incapable of trying an item on and saying ""This looks good, I'm going to buy it."" Instead, I try things on, maybe like some of them, put everything back and run from the store crying. I wish that were an exaggeration, but it isn't.

I am getting a nice sized tax return this year and I want to treat myself to some items that are versatile, classic, and that I feel good wearing.

As these types of post are supposed to serve the general population of the sub, I'm not going to ask for specific style or size recommendations. For what it's worth, I am straight-sized (upper single digits) and can pull off most cuts and colors.

Instead what I would like to ask is: What items do you feel are worth spending more on and what items do you value, well, value on? Should I pay $100 for denim that \*really\* fits and spend $6 on tees at Target? Is $30 denim from H&M not much different than premium denim but dressy leggings are worth $65 from LuLuLemon?

Plz halp.

I can count on one hand the number of times I've ""gone shopping"" for clothes for myself and I am 34 years old.",0.21114718614718608,0.3911796536796537,positive
H&M,"Hi!

I'm sorry you're experiencing frustration trying to find clothes that work for you. But I am glad you felt you could come here for help!

I'll talk about some things I have found worth it:

Jeans - You get what you pay for. Cheap jeans (Zara, H&M, Old Navy) are not a good investment. They stretch out, are thin, don't fit as well, especially if you want a jean that sculpts your derriere. Also, they are often made in poor conditions overseas (not everyone cares about that, but I do). 

Mid-range jeans are often a bit better (Gap, Levis) in terms of stretch and shape retention, but are still made in poor conditions and still aren't that great IMO.

My go-to brand of investment jeans is Citizens of Humanity, particularly for the boyfriend jean styles (I'm not a fan of their rocket skinnies, they are just too high waisted for me). They don't stretch out and lose their shape, and they have great cuts and washes. They just look like a premium jean. I also like Rag and Bone (for skinnies); again, not too much stretch, no bagging out and they retain washes well. Both companies are American and AFAIK make their jeans in the US. I have bought both brands new and through eBay (used) and have never been disappointed. If you do go used, make sure your seller is trustworthy. (If you aren't familiar with the fits of these brands I might suggest trying some on in store and then hunting down a used pair online).

For leggings I have been a long-time Lulu customer, and as much as they tick me off I'm having a really hard time finding a replacement for their leggings (in particular the Align pant, which is a great product). I have skinny legs, muscular butt and a tummy so I can be challenging to fit in a legging. I'm not a big fan of wearing leggings outside of the house or yoga studio, but I understand some people want to wear them everywhere. In my experience cheaper leggings means thinner material, loose threads or just awkward fit. Leggings from the Gap and Old Navy do not work for me. Nor do the leggings from Lulu's offshoot brand Kit and Ace. Ditto for Löle. Alo is okay, but very pricey and too trendy. Onzie's fabric drives me nuts (too shiny; I like thick, matte black leggings). 

T-shirts are so hit and miss. You can spend 30 bucks on a tee from Everlane and it gets holes in two washes. Then you'll grab a discount tee out of a bin from Old Navy and it lasts you ten years. There is little rhyme or reason. I guess my advice would be to stick to thicker cotton or linen or bamboo knits (and am not a fan of polyester and don't like it in my clothing). Thin t-shirts can feel really soft, but they're also going to get destroyed fast. T-shirts with viscose will wrinkle a lot (and look cheap) and those with polyester in them are going to be sweaty. Basically fabric composition and weight will dictate a lot about how the t-shirt will hold up over time. I find I have far more success buying cotton basics in store, because then I can at least feel how thick they are/how the hand feels/look at the stitching quality.

Lingerie is another area where I think you have to spend a bit more. It's always worth it to have a proper fitting and to invest in undergarments that make you look and feel great. It is a real confidence boost and can improve your daily comfort a lot too. You don't have to buy the fanciest french lingerie, but a well-made American bra with quality fabric might be well worth looking at. I find its also worth it to have a few different types of undergarments (ones for sport, ones for sleep, ones for everyday, ones for formal occasions and ones for period). 

When I shop I basically shop by fabric and colour as much or more than style. I stick to very classic styles and when I find something I like, I will get it in multiples (if the colours suit me...I am very picky about colour). If it is cotton, silk, linen, bamboo, merino or cashmere, I'm interested. I like my clothes to be luxurious, but in a very understated way. 

I splurge on silk scarves, shoes and handbags, coats and jewelry. They are the statement pieces of my wardrobe and can be worn again and again with no concern for my current weight/pant size. A great shoe or handbag can really elevate a pretty basic outfit to something special. And like most other things, expensive shoes and handbags are often better made and will outlast cheap trendy  ones (but you do have to put some care into taking care of them). Of course, these are things you should do plenty of research on before committing to; there's no use in splurging on a $2500 handbag that just doesn't suit your lifestyle. 

Basically, I'm the kinda person whose wardrobe is 80% black or denim. I make it interesting by adding accessories. Almost everything I own works together; I have learned that flashy but impractical pieces will just sit unworn and I will regret buying them. I'm not a minimalist by most people's standards, but I definitely have refined my look and my wardrobe over the past decade and have less items (but much higher quality) than when I started out.

Gap,"I would splurge on shoes! Good shoes can pull a whole outfit together, make it look nicer, and will last you forever, not to mention will be much more comfortable. One of my favorite staples is leather booties, I prefer black, but brown is also good depending on your wardrobe. They don’t have to be super expensive either, $100 or a little more. Another splurge is a leather jacket, for the same reasons as the shoes, a classic that can go with anything. I would also suggest a cashmere sweater if you don’t have one yet. 

As for where to save money, I would save on the basics. Plain cotton tshirts, button ups, sweaters, etc. can all be bought for good quality at reasonable prices, including Old Navy and Gap.

Gap,This is funny to me bc I always felt Levi’s catered more to the straight up and down style and I’m very curvy so most Levi’s fit horribly on me. either fit the waist but are too tight in the thighs or fit my thighs but huge waist gap.

Madewell,"I agree with others that it makes the most sense to spend on what you wear often. For example, I wear sunglasses every single day and I have a $70 pair. Of course, I could easily get by with a cheaper pair, I just wouldn't like them as much. Outerwear or jewelry can be a good splurge for the same reason. 

I also have a pair of boots that I spent $140 on. I wear them all the time in the winter/fall/spring because they are waterproof leather boots and they are great for snowy-ish weather. 

Even though I wear jeans a lot, I personally don't find designer denim to be worth it. I don't think it's much of a step up in quality compared to mid-range mall brands and a lot of times it fits me worse- a lot of designer brands seem to be designed around women who have slimmer thighs than I do and sizing up just makes it oversize everywhere else. When I buy new, I look at brands like loft, banana republic, or madewell. After sales / coupon codes I would expect to pay $40-60 for new jeans.

In general, I think there is a tendency to overuse price as a proxy for quality. Below a threshold, it can be accurate. Above that threshold, you're mostly paying to have more options. That's not a bad thing of course- it might be the difference between something you really like / feel confident in and something that's just okay, but I think it's worth acknowledging when it happens. 

Tbh, lululemon leggings are really good. I bought a pair because they were cheapish in a consignment store and they've quickly become my favorite pair of workout leggings. I'm considering buying another pair even though they're annoyingly expensive and even the used market is weirdly pricey compared to other brands.

Uniqlo skinnies in my experience have been pretty “true to size” and fit whatever letter sizing that I usually am in other brands. so if you know you are typically a m/l/xl or whatever, that might be a good hint at where to start looking with uniqlo, and adjust based on your measurements.",0.14947916666666666,0.44166666666666665,positive

H&M,"There are different kinds obviously, but I avoid polyester because: microplastics, holds on to smells more easily, some polyesters don’t breathe at all so they make me sweat more, and I find sweaters with a high polyester and acrylic content pull incredibly easily and make the garment look worn out after a few wears. For winter clothes, I might buy something with 10-20% polyester in it if serves a purpose like stretch. In summer clothes though? Hell no. I have some “reformation-inspired” dressed from eBay that are 100% polyester and they are not comfortable to wear compared to a viscose or simple cotton-linen blend.

Edit: over time you’ll get to know which brands have “okay” feeling polyester and which produce low-quality stuff. If an h&m sweater has acrylic in it, I guarantee you it will pill within a day. Also, I don’t think it is necessary for our clothes (that we use for few years to a few decades tops) to be made of nearly everlasting fabrics that are incredibly polluting to produce, take forever to break down and often can’t (or don’t) be easily recycled. A 100% cotton, linen, wool,… shirt will serve the purpose of dressing you comfortably, stylishly and seasonally appropriate just as well.

Uniqlo,"I’m now strategic about when I wear my dry clean only stuff because I have a little who likes to get boogers on the shoulders of my work clothes. I also dress more for comfort on weekends because there are endless errands to run. 

I worked luxury retail for years and my body hasn’t changed a heck of a lot since my early 20s (I’m almost 40 now). I have what is politely called a “swimmer’s body,” tall with lean lines but broad in the shoulders and a curvy bum. It’s a bit of a challenge to dress but I’ve mastered it over the years. I still wear whatever I want though I’ve worked in male-dominated fields over the past few years so I probably wear more edgy cuts and accessories than I used to just as a kind of armour. I also love campy sportswear (think 80s/90s neon and outrageous prints) and I will never stop wearing that stuff but in very basic, masculine cuts. I love dressing like an early 90s awkward male teen going on vacation (I’m female, obviously). It makes me happy, for some dumb reason. 

I’m a definite collector of clothes and my favourite pieces are still older Phillip Lim/Isabel Marant/Kenzo items. But now I wear more basics from Vince, Aritzia and Uniqlo because I’m more pressed for time than I was and when you have a kid you’re always at the damned mall so it’s right there. 

I still only trust my own taste, though. I only pay attention to trends if they suit me. I dislike full looks that are too referential to a certain period because they look costume-y (rockabilly, ew). 

I’ll always love to collect clothes but I also dream if a time when I’m so stratospherically successful in my career that I can show up to meetings in a sweatshirt and New Balance dad sneakers and no one can say a word. IMO that’s what every professional woman should strive for, ultimately.

ETA: my style pro-tip since I was a teen is this: know what always looks great on you as a rule (for me it’s anything cut close to the neck and, in general, no cap sleeves) BUT try on everything you can, even things you think may be unflattering.  That’s how you discover new cuts that work for you.

Gap,"In HS I just wanted to blend in and be comfortable. In college I started to like clothes and got more in touch with my feminine side. I wore tighter clothes and liked make up. I wanted to experiment with fashion and be unique but had a small wardrobe because I had no money and moved a lot. I wore a lot of flare pants :)

After college, I spent way too much money on clothes (I had the money to afford it and the social and professional life to justify it). I loved pencil skirts and heels. I also became obsessed with blazers. I loved colors and prints! Fast fashion was also in full force but we didn't really understand it then. My wardrobe was very compartmentalized (work clothes, going out, lounge wear, exercise, weekend).  It was fun but I honestly somewhat regret all the money I spent on fashion. 

After 30 I got more practical. I stopped dying my hair blond.  I also could no longer wear heels. More that I was now a mom than my age,  but I had to learn to love flats. I started online shopping a lot bc I didn't have the time to go to malls or browse the likes of TJMaxx. I shopped a lot at the Gap.com because I could get clothes for the whole family at one place and it was convenient. My wardrobe was huge because I never threw anything out. I never wore skirts or dresses anymore except special occasions. I finally did a big closet clean out after the birth of my second and literally still had clothes from college and even high school that I finally tossed. I reorganized my whole closet and have maintained a better system. I also started cutting my own hair. I tried to get into athlesure which blew up aroubd then, but I honestly maintained a fairly compartmentalized wardrobe, for better or worse. 

I'm entering my 40s now and am appreciating the value of fewer, nicer pieces. My kids are still little (I have three now) so I can't afford nice things, but have discovered thrifting. I am gravitating toward neutrals and more boho vibes rather than tailored. I like skirts and dresses again.  I need good shoes and am learning to love sneakers. I know the value of a good bra! My wardrobe is still too big but I am starting to give myself permission to throw things out and have a goal of paring my wardrobe down to basics I love with just a few new things a year to keep it fresh.

Madewell,"The older I am, the more I buy whatever I want. I know that sounds simple and cavalier, but it really is that.

I was also concerned about dressing appropriately for the occasion and practicality of my clothes. Concerned whether my style reflected who I was a person. Concerned about giving off the right vibe. Concerned about whether I looked like a pretentious shallow fuck, a tweenie bopper ingenue, trying too hard, trying not hard enough, professional enough to be taken seriously by old men, hot enough to be hit on by young men etc. etc. etc. Pretty much a decade and a half of really attributing quite a lot to my clothing.

Now in my late 30s I’m just like ""whatever lol."" Designer silk dress? Sure. Androgynous menswear my husband calls my ""lesbian clothes""? Sure. Thrifted weird cutesy girly purse shaped like a dog? Also sure. Basically, I'm comfortable. I've already gone to all the ""special dress"" places and events over and over again - not my first date, not my first interview, not my first office job, not my first conference, not my first holiday, not my first black tie, not my first time meeting the inlaws, not even my third or fifth times for those things.

Also, I don't see fashion as so representative anymore. I used to be really concerned about the various messages I was sending about myself through the clothes I wear, and now it's more like ""what do I feel like today?"" and when I shop, it's less ""is this dress me?"" and more ""does this dress visually appeal to me?""

Questions about how not to turn into a living ice cube are right up there with questions about what to take on vacation.

And so, without further ado…

**HOW TO SURVIVE COLD AND SNOW WITHOUT DYING**

1 **Layer the shit out of everything**

You’re wearing a t-shirt and a cardigan?  That shit might be good enough for Florida.  It’s not going to cut it when the cold winds blow in the north.  You better be wearing a cami and a shirt and a sweater under a jacket which is under a coat which is accessorized with a scarf and a hat and mittens…  Basically, check in the mirror before you leave the house.  Do you look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/Stay-puft-marshmallow-man.jpg)?  No?  GO PUT MORE CLOTHES ON.

2 **”But that doesn’t look good!”**

First of all - do you want to die?  No?  Then it’s totally worth it.  Second of all - cute in the cold is all relative.  It’s like surfer style.  It’s its own deal and “cute for super cold” isn’t the same as “cute for not super cold”.  It’s like wearing a raincoat when it’s raining out.  Wearing a less cute one is better than wearing a super cute one and getting wet and cold. At a certain temperature, practical and functional take precedence. The ‘cute’ outfits you see a lot of bloggers wearing are [not realistic](http://www.thecollegeprepster.com/2014/12/ask-blogger-arent-you-cold.html) for the weather. Once the temperature drops, you won’t be out of place [in a sea of parkas](http://i.imgur.com/wDXpoJW.jpg).

3 **Materials**

Natural materials like wool, silk, down, and fur will often be warmer than their synthetic counterparts. Many retailers offer ethical down options and provide information about how their materials are sourced. Wearing good materials will totally help with keeping warm.

*For a base layer* in super cold, silk or merino wool long underwear are the best shit you can ever own.  It’s not cheap, but it’s amazing.  My mom has had the same silk long underwear for over 30 years.  She really only wears it when snowmobiling or downhill skiing because otherwise it’s too warm, but even so it’s lasted really well.  Both silk and merino wool are not only super warm but also super thin so it fits under everything. Often, they will be warmer than their synthetic alternatives at a similar thickness.  Merino wool also has awesome moisture wicking properties so if you do sweat it won’t make you chilled, and most silks are treated to provide better moisture wicking as well. Merino wool has the added benefit of being naturally antibacterial. If you don’t want to spend the money on silk or wool long underwear, **Uniqlo Heattech** is a pretty good alternative at a cheaper price.  Keep in mind it’s super thin, though (so it will fit under clothes) so you can’t wear it as say - pants.

*For pants* - wool is your best bet if you’re working in an office and need professional dress pants.  Some people feel that wool is too scratchy even lined, so be aware if your skin is okay with it.  I love wool dress pants in the winter.  So classy and so warm.  Plus a silky lining against your skin tends to feel super nice.  Jeans are notoriously chilly in the winter.  I don’t know what it is about denim but wind goes straight through.  Jeans with a base layer is super warm and I would recommend it highly but without a base layer is probably going to be too cold.  Thick leggings, ponte pants or fleece lined leggings/tights are really nice and cozy on their own I’ve found unless there’s a strong wind. 

*For sweaters* - wool is your friend.  Cashmere is ideal, but imo all wools are fantastic.  So warm and wool handles moisture really well so you don’t end up cold and wet.  Fleece is a terrible coat but a great jacket to wear under a coat.  The wind goes straight through, but if it’s protected from wind it’s an excellent insulator.

*As far as outerwear*, wool is great.  Fleece lined gloves and hats are the holy grail.  I had a pair of leather gloves that were fleece lined that were one of my best cold weather items ever.  So warm but light enough to drive in.  If your head and ears get cold fleece lined hats can be found anywhere that sells ski gear.  Coziest beanies on the planet.  :)  Coats in wool, leather (lined, preferably with something thick and fluffy) or down are the best.  Down will be the warmest, but can get pretty wet if you’re not in a super cold or dry climate, so keep an eye out for ‘waterproof’ (not water resistant) parkas.  Wool handles wet the best but does have a distinctive wet wool ‘smell’.  Leather is a good balance between the two.  Waterproofing is particularly important in gloves and coats since once you’re wet, you’re cold.

4 **Wear a long coat with a high collar.**

I thought long coats were “uncool” for a super long time (yay highschool insecurity) but once I started wearing long coats I could never go back.  A midlength coat goes a long way in ensuring that your midsection doesn’t get exposed to the cold and gives you something warm and dry to sit on and a super long coat ensures that your legs are always warm and that they never have to touch anything cold or wet.  I tried to buy coats that fell no more than a couple inches above my ankle.  It’s like a column of warmth.  Also, a high collar is so great.  If you buy a peacoat make sure that the collar will button up all the way.  Lots of them only lay open, and that leaves you a big V in the front for cold air to get into.  Also, hoods are pretty dope.

5 **Be aware of footwear.**

One thing I learned is that if your feet are cold, your whole body will be cold.  Wool socks are your friend.  **Smartwool** is really the best imo, but some people prefer **Darn Tough**.  For cheaper alternatives **Costco** has amazing wool socks and I’ve bought good ones in sporting stores too.  I bought some Hue wool socks this year that aren’t nearly as warm as my heavy-duty sporting good store socks or smartwool but are a good lightweight wool.  Forget other socks exist for the winter.  If you’re wearing tights, wear wool socks over your tights and then boots.  It’s the best way.

Wear shoes that keep your feet dry.  One thing with footwear is to be aware of what your life is like.  I wore normal shoes with wool socks all winter in northern WI even though temps dropped as low as -40 pretty regularly simply because I went from my house to my car to where ever I was going and was never outside for more than 20 minutes.  If you’re outside for longer, you need snow boots.  **Sorel** is one of the best out there as far as snow boots go.  **LL Bean**’s duck boots tend to be very popular, but the traditional boot will likely need to be layered with thick socks; they also offer insulated versions for winter conditions.  When it comes to snow boots, buy for function not for looks.  You want them to be warm, always, and you do not want to be slipping, sliding, and falling on poorly cleared sidewalks.  If you’re only outside for short periods normal boots should be fine, just be aware of a couple things.  a) will they keep your feet dry?  b) thick soles get your feet further off the ground keeping them from getting as cold.  c)  you need room for wool socks.  d) will they be stained by road salt?  d) make sure they’re not slick on ice or you’ll hurt yourself.

6 **Be conscious of cold spots and work toward getting rid of them.**

Different people get cold in different places.  Personally, I found that my neck and chest being exposed always makes me cold.  Turtlenecks and scarves are essential for me keeping warm when it’s cold out.  I also get super cold feet.  So I make sure to always always wear warm socks.  Keep this in mind.  If you notice you’re always way colder if you’re not wearing a hat, wear a hat always.  It will help keep the rest of your body warm.  If you get cold hands, invest in great mittens.  Etc.  

At the end of the day living in the cold is all about being aware of your body.  Realizing where you’re cold and finding ways to solve that problem.  Style is always important, but when it’s between frostbite and stylish or not stylish and warm - always choose warm.  Also, like I said.  Watch what the people around you are wearing.  Most cold weather places definitely have a cold weather style that goes along with them.

The different colors of yarn are carried along the inside of the piece when they aren't being used, so you basically wind up with an extra layer of wool inside your sweater.

Uniqlo,"I live in North Dakota and like to look cute. I layer my tights A LOT, 2 pairs from about 30 to 0 degrees F, and then 3 for anything colder. Today it's about 30 and kind of wet/breezy (the worst kind of cold) and I wore a pair of fleece lined tights (deceptive title as they aren't very warm) and a pair of regular Hues plus a pair of Smartwool socks because I had to walk about half a mile. I'll keep these on when I walk my dogs later.

Also, as for boots, LEATHER LEATHER LEATHER. You can get fleece lined Sorels and you'll be warm, but I think a good pair of leather boots + layered tights is about all you need. Fake leather and your feet will freeze. I wore a pair of Lucky Brand booties all winter last year and was fine. The only times I even slipped (and ND does become an ice rink as we typically don't salt shit) were when I was drunk. Skol! This year I purchased [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00REB4O1Y?colid=O9LWOTXGRF9L&coliid=I1WE2TDK7M68XH&psc=1&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl) and I think they're going to be great. I've had heeled Timberlands before here and that treaded heel is going to be awesome.

I do think a long coat is imperative, but would add that quality is so important and that you should get one with a hood. Hats are cute but a hood will save your ears and your hair! Esp. important if you're like me and have a professional dress job where you can't wear a beanie all day (though I'd like to). I had a long down Calvin Klein puffer for a year and it was bullshit. I looked like a sleeping bag, but I was always freezing (though that could have been because that was the winter it kept getting to -60 in the middle of the day. Wind chill!!) and had to buy a long, fleecey AND furry coat from Uniqlo to layer with it. This year I have a parka from Aritzia and while it's rated for -20 and mountain climbing, I think this is bullshit (the arms get chilly in 30 degrees!) and am in the market for a nice fleece to layer.

Pants variety - I’m not ditching my skinnies because sometimes they are the best option but I am loving wider or straight options for variety tans a slim straight leg is usually the best on me so again I’m enjoying their more ready availability.

I’m not sure if this is a trend but - color/pattern/detail in general. Maybe this falls into the zeitgeist pendulum swinging back from minimalism towards maximalism. I prefer to mix my plain and fun pieces so things don’t get overwhelming but I find I really really missed color and fun details while I flirted with jumping o the minimalist bandwagon. Fuchsia is my favorite color tbh so I have stopped pretending otherwise even if sometimes want to wear a giant beige sack instead.

Corduroy - I love it to look at but can’t seem to wear it maybe because I lived in corduroy as a teen... but I wear a lot of the other things that have resurfaced from that era so who knows. I got a cropped rusty red pair of corduroy pants from madewell for about $10 back when the covid sales first hit and I still haven’t worn them because I can’t figure out quite what to do with them.

\------------------------------

In one of the previous posts regarding quality clothing, someone asked for recommendations on quality brands that are worth the money.  I have been keeping track of my wardrobe for 8 years, including brand, type of clothes, cost, cost per wear (CPW) how many times I've worn the item, and the last time I've worn the item. As I donate, sell, or discard the clothes, I remove the item from my list.

**Background**: I'm in my late 20s /early 30s and have switched between outdoorsy science-related jobs to indoor office-based jobs. My wardrobe is a mix of both casual and business casual clothes. My income was modest for many years and my career only kicked off recently. From the start of my Excel inventory, I bought mostly from mall-brand clothing. I recently began investing in more office-appropriate clothing and perceived higher-quality brands. This skews my CPW up for certain categories.

I've been trying to buy more quality items over quantity and will be more mindful of my purchases in the future. It'd be interesting to see how my spreadsheet evolves over the years and compare which brands had items with the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW.

&#x200B;

**Brands most donated and henceforth excluded from Excel:** *Old Navy, Forever 21, H&M, Zara* \--> Most of these clothes had a life span of 2 months to 2 years in my closet. They lose their shape and color fairly quickly compared to other brands. These brands were excluded from my Cost Per Wear Analysis because I had gotten rid of so many clothes from those brands.

&#x200B;

**Here is what I found based on type of clothing:**

**Other observations**:

* Anthropologie was not worth it at all for me. I bought two dresses on a whim and wear them only once to a wedding.
* American Eagle was pretty worth it for me. Their items have a long duration in my closet and they have a low CPW.
* Banana Republic items last a long time in my closet but the CPW is high. It indicates to me that I don't love their clothing style and don't wear their items enough.
* Items that I had bought from subscription services (i.e. StitchFix) have really poor CPW. I felt compelled to only keep the items only to avoid the styling fee and I did not end up loving the items.
* The median CPW indicates that everyday outerwear, t-shirts, and sweaters had the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW in my closet. On the other hand, special occasion bags and outerwear had the highest CPW.
* Fast fashion is not worth it. While some items remain in my closet for years, the majority were donated after 3 months to 2 years of wearing.  Again, donated, sold, and discarded items were excluded from my analysis.

**Future Predictions**: Over the next few years, I think I will donate most of my fast fashion items. CPW from brands like MM LaFleur (of which I will have heavy work-outfit rotations) will decrease in CPW but stand the test of time.

I don't know if this is helpful for anyone. I'm really curious to see how my Excel progresses as I move away from fast-fashion and more towards quality items. I also wonder if my analysis correlates with other's perception of the brands listed.

In one of the previous posts regarding quality clothing, someone asked for recommendations on quality brands that are worth the money.  I have been keeping track of my wardrobe for 8 years, including brand, type of clothes, cost, cost per wear (CPW) how many times I've worn the item, and the last time I've worn the item. As I donate, sell, or discard the clothes, I remove the item from my list.

**Background**: I'm in my late 20s /early 30s and have switched between outdoorsy science-related jobs to indoor office-based jobs. My wardrobe is a mix of both casual and business casual clothes. My income was modest for many years and my career only kicked off recently. From the start of my Excel inventory, I bought mostly from mall-brand clothing. I recently began investing in more office-appropriate clothing and perceived higher-quality brands. This skews my CPW up for certain categories.

I've been trying to buy more quality items over quantity and will be more mindful of my purchases in the future. It'd be interesting to see how my spreadsheet evolves over the years and compare which brands had items with the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW.

Uniqlo,"I have the Etsuko dress in the color ""Claret"" and it is my most worn MM LaFleur dress. It's machine-washable, has sleeves, and has pockets. It transcends seasons - I can wear it during the spring, fall, and winter (with some Uniqlo Heattech underneath).  I think it is a good starting point.

I also get a lot of compliments on the Taylor dress. The best part is the hidden pocket! However it is pricier than the Etsuko dress and I probably would not invest in it if I was just testing the waters with the brand.

**Other observations**:

* Anthropologie was not worth it at all for me. I bought two dresses on a whim and wear them only once to a wedding.
* American Eagle was pretty worth it for me. Their items have a long duration in my closet and they have a low CPW.
* Banana Republic items last a long time in my closet but the CPW is high. It indicates to me that I don't love their clothing style and don't wear their items enough.
* Items that I had bought from subscription services (i.e. StitchFix) have really poor CPW. I felt compelled to only keep the items only to avoid the styling fee and I did not end up loving the items.
* The median CPW indicates that everyday outerwear, t-shirts, and sweaters had the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW in my closet. On the other hand, special occasion bags and outerwear had the highest CPW.
* Fast fashion is not worth it. While some items remain in my closet for years, the majority were donated after 3 months to 2 years of wearing.  Again, donated, sold, and discarded items were excluded from my analysis.

**Future Predictions**: Over the next few years, I think I will donate most of my fast fashion items. CPW from brands like MM LaFleur (of which I will have heavy work-outfit rotations) will decrease in CPW but stand the test of time.

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is helpful for anyone. I'm really curious to see how my Excel progresses as I move away from fast-fashion and more towards quality items. I also wonder if my analysis correlates with other's perception of the brands listed.

I have updated the below chart to include medians so that newer items won't skew my results.

Here is a screenshot of my Excel sheet. I am a huge fan of ""Slicers"" to filter my inventory. I also keep my accessories and handbags as separate tabs. You can also toggle the ""Average"" row on the bottom to do various calculations: [https://imgur.com/a/y0gAXBE](https://imgur.com/a/y0gAXBE)

Here is a template of my Excel spreadsheet. You can use Google Sheets or download the Excel .xlsx document. Slicers are only available on Excel: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rt6-\_nPiO7o85Np-vSB2cIA7EE63bjL0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rt6-_nPiO7o85Np-vSB2cIA7EE63bjL0)

In one of the previous posts regarding quality clothing, someone asked for recommendations on quality brands that are worth the money.  I have been keeping track of my wardrobe for 8 years, including brand, type of clothes, cost, cost per wear (CPW) how many times I've worn the item, and the last time I've worn the item. As I donate, sell, or discard the clothes, I remove the item from my list.

**Background**: I'm in my late 20s /early 30s and have switched between outdoorsy science-related jobs to indoor office-based jobs. My wardrobe is a mix of both casual and business casual clothes. My income was modest for many years and my career only kicked off recently. From the start of my Excel inventory, I bought mostly from mall-brand clothing. I recently began investing in more office-appropriate clothing and perceived higher-quality brands. This skews my CPW up for certain categories.

I've been trying to buy more quality items over quantity and will be more mindful of my purchases in the future. It'd be interesting to see how my spreadsheet evolves over the years and compare which brands had items with the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW.

&#x200B;

**Brands most donated and henceforth excluded from Excel:** *Old Navy, Forever 21, H&M, Zara* \--> Most of these clothes had a life span of 2 months to 2 years in my closet. They lose their shape and color fairly quickly compared to other brands. These brands were excluded from my Cost Per Wear Analysis because I had gotten rid of so many clothes from those brands.

&#x200B;

**Here is what I found based on type of clothing:**

&#x200B;

I only write this because I am, like many, pretty fresh out of university and sliding in through the doors of the Business World™ on a banana peel in my early/mid 20s. I’m not quite emotionally prepared to part with my crop tops and cute platform shoes and oversized hipster jumpers but I know I also need to dress convincingly as someone who knows what the H*ck they’re doing (read: trickery).

(2) The clean cut neutral and soft palettes of Japanese literally-straight-edge-clothing that is somehow boxy without being unflattering to curves

(3) An updated version of the ca. 2006 Zooey Deschanels indie singers of the world (i.e. still so-called ditsy and floral with occasional polka dots, just not quite so harsh colour wise)

(1) The Scandinavian geometric-inspired style that looks like the personification of Instagram-esque IKEA furniture

(2) The clean cut neutral and soft palettes of Japanese literally-straight-edge-clothing that is somehow boxy without being unflattering to curves

(3) An updated version of the ca. 2006 Zooey Deschanels indie singers of the world (i.e. still so-called ditsy and floral with occasional polka dots, just not quite so harsh colour wise)

(4) Librarians & teachers *forever*

Brand suggestions for this style includes ASOS, Zara, Mango, Uniqlo, Muji, H&M, and LOTS of independent stores. I also want to give a shoutout to the [Scandinavian Archeologist inspo album](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/84gxm5/scandinavian_archaeologist_an_inspiration_album/) by /u/eastiv which is, for all intents and purposes, simply a *better* version of this album IMHO. This is my first ever Inspo album so I hope you enjoy it!

Edit: A lot of comments on the shortness of skirts and some clothes being unprofessional, haha! Yes, I agree — I would never wear short skirts/some of this stuff in my work place and frankly you probably shouldn’t either. I guess for most outfits I’m just looking at the overall colours/styles/etc rather than saying “I would wear THIS” so take that as you will!

I don't know how old you are (not that you can't wear certain things at certain ages, just for your own frame of reference), what your life is like, what you find comfortable or attractive in clothing, so it's hard to make specific recommendations. 

Honestly, I would head to the mall. No need to intend to buy anything, just to observe. Look at what different stores are selling, see if you can identify common elements. Take note of cuts, colors, fabrics, how things tend to be styled on mannequins and in ads. You can also scroll on social media—Instagram, Tiktok, Pinterest. And on trendy fashion retailers' websites, especially those that tend to sort things by trend. (In my experience, the faster the fast fashion, the more likely this is.) I know for sure it was Dollskill's and Cider's original schtick, although in very different ways. I think places like Pretty Little Thing, Shein, possibly even Urban Outfitters will also have trend-based tabs you can scroll through. Just wander around (virtually), see what you notice. You can also try fashion-related media like magazines (Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Allure, etc) or blogs (WhoWhatWear, Refinery29, [anything on this list of similar sites](https://www.similarweb.com/website/whowhatwear.com/#competitors)). They will often have very specific articles titled stuff like ""crochet is back!"" and ""bubble shorts are coming—do we love or hate them?"" so that can be a good way to nail down specific trending elements.

As you're observing, it's completely fine to have initial opinions, but try not to count anything out just yet until you've tried it—none of this ""I can't wear that kind of pants because my thighs, blah blah blah,"" nope, we're not talking down about our bodies and we're keeping an open mind. (And if something doesn't look right, it's the CLOTHES' fault, not your body's.) But if you're finding yourself especially drawn to something, great! That's the perfect place to start.

The tricky thing is, LOTS of things are ""in style"" right now, but often in parallel lanes, although some do overlap. That's basically what ""aesthetics"" or ""cores"" are, if you've heard those terms thrown around. (Ironically, ""coastal grandma"" was a fairly popular one a couple years ago, so you may not be as unfashionable as you think! Lmao) Those aesthetic labels can be overwhelming and even feel restrictive—don't worry about nailing a certain aesthetic right now, although if having a clear framework like that helps you, go for it! IMO the easier way to approach it is to notice if any particular aesthetic appeals to you more than others, OR if you realize the items you find yourself drawn to might fit into one of those, that will help you seek out further pieces.",0.20775913900913903,0.5491107503607503,positive

Zara,"It’s only September, but we’ve already started planning outfits for the fall season. Have you already started noticing the new trends creeping into stores and magazines? It’s a real mixed bag of styles and elements for every taste and age, a lot of it predictably inspired by the 2000s. While this is by no means an exhaustive list of trends or all the most popular influences, they do tend to be some of the recurring styles I’ve seen in the new collections so far. If you’re still getting your shopping list ready, here are some of the trends you’ll see this fall season:



#1 sheer


If you’ve taken a gander at online stores lately, there’s no way you missed the fact that sheer clothes are in. Very appropriate for summer, but not inconvenient for fall, a sheer element is the perfect way to bring a touch of sexy to an outfit, while also adding texture and visual interest. 


[Sheer tops](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9a/1f/87/9a1f8788177faaa92684f8779814c2a3.jpg) are everywhere - mostly mesh and [organza](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5d/88/89/5d88891f27a789f01803ef617d065825.jpg) - but they’re not the only garments that are getting the see-through treatment. [Sheer midi skirts](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/french-actress-olga-kurylenko-poses-for-a-photo-call-before-news-photo-925015184-1557795027.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*) and dresses - [with or without slips underneath](https://outfittrends.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/outfit-with-sheer-skirts-2-333x500.jpg), depending on how daring you are - are an ideal choice for any holiday parties you’ve got coming up, or just regular nights out. 


##Best way to wear it: 



[Jeans a nice top, anyone?](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/6kcPXDgkW-EesiPCr_AUfFDzPsA/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/10/09/860/n/1922564/a86b5ee3d24310f7_GettyImages-845850256/i/Retailers-offering-plenty-sheer-top-options-Fall-our.jpg) Why not make that top sheer? If you feel uncomfortable going all out, then a sheer element goes perfectly with an otherwise conservative outfit. If you’re wearing a midi skirt and a blazer, a peek of a sheer top can be a great contrast. A sheer midi with high boots and a turtleneck sweater is perfectly appropriate, while still flashing a little calf to keep things interesting. 


#2 marked waists



Have you heard The Good News about waists? Boxy haters, rejoice, and get your credit cards ready: the tide is turning back towards 2000s style tops and jackets, and that means fewer long, boxy blazers, and more hip length, [wasp-waisted garments](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/64ee55932f2f6fa44845e097/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1258834191.jpg). 


Blazers aren’t the only ones that are getting the cinched treatment, that also goes for coats, shirts, and dresses. It’s a structured, feminine style that looks great with voluminous pieces and is made even more impactful by the addition of [prominent shoulders](https://www.versace.com/dw/image/v2/BGWN_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-ver-master-catalog/default/dw63eccb2a/original/90_1012080-1A06750_1B000_16_HourglassSingle~BreastedBlazer-Clothing-Versace-online-store_1_2.jpg?sw=850&q=85&strip=true). Versace calls it an ""hourglass"" blazer, for those furiously keyword-ing at home. 



##Best way to wear it: 



A top with a cinched waist looks especially harmonious with voluminous pants. A pair of high-waisted palazzos goes perfectly with a tie-waist shirt. A [blazer](https://thefrankieshop.com/cdn/shop/products/peak-lapel-hourglass-blazer-in-black-blazer-more-than-yesterday-637915.jpg?v=1578443192) with this kind of detail can work with pants, but you can also pair a straight mini skirt with it for an 80s inspired skirt suit look. 




Midi skirts can also work with this style of blazer, albeit with a bit more care for proportions. It won't necessarily be a ""traditional"" silhouette, but it *can* be an interesting one. Full midi skirts can also be beautiful here, especially for a more formal look that steps a bit outside the norm. 



#3 wrap sweaters



Ballet-core may be older news, but it’s still going strong, and it’s sprouting new iterations and trends. After leg warmers and sheer skirts, it also gave way to the return of [the wrap sweater](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/65/18/f66518542463b21d348a6f930942c767.png). Usually made of thinner fabric and typically in shades of delicate pink, black, white, or gray, a ballet-inspired wrap sweater is as feminine as it is practical. 



Sheer ones are common, but it’s not the only style out there, by any means. In the coming months we can expect to see them in various fabrics and colors, as they make a great fresh alternative to other types of cardigans that may feel a little stale. 



##Best way to wear it: 



It can be worn by itself, on top of a satin cami, paired with jeans or a midi skirt. Or it can even work as a top layer for an evening dress. It’s a great topper for evening weddings going into fall. The temperatures go lower, but the dresses stay thin and strappy, so an elegant cover-up that isn’t a pashmina doesn’t hurt. Or you can go in the complete opposite direction and lean fully into a ballet-core flavored athleisure look and [wear it with leggings and sneakers](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ebb1b2c07f0f111e4ac241c/644ad42d14c8651ca41b87f7_52fb6dc6.png) 



#4 fringe skirt




Fringe is creeping back into fashion in all sorts of ways - we’ve been seeing some leather fringed purses and hopefully vests soon - and one of the most fun iterations has to be the fringe skirt. The fringe skirt, or the [carwash skirt](http://www.laiamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/estelle-chemouny-prada-embroidered-fringed-skirt-instagram.jpg), as it’s affectionately nicknamed, is technically a midi skirt, but the length is - you guessed it - FRINGE. 


It has movement, it has [drama](https://dint.img18.kr/PRODUCT/2023_UPDATE/BOTTOM/SK2511/DINT0SK25110SV013.jpg), it’s comfortable, and it’s a way more interesting way to wear a skirt. Functioning as both a mini and a midi, basically, the fringe skirt is sexy without being revealing, it’s fun without being exaggerated, and it’s a totally unique way to wear a skirt. It also sort of plays into the sheer trend because it puts some leg on show, but not really. It’s more a of a peek-a-boo. 


##Best way to wear it: 



Because the skirt is the fun element of the outfit, you can keep the rest simple. A button-down shirt, a basic boot, neutral colors. Orrr you can kick it up a notch with some fun heels and an oversized blazer. 



#5 silver




Even if you’re not a big Bowie fan, silver is surprisingly versatile. Basically anything you wear can be made in a cool metallic silver fabric. For now, it seems to be mostly relegated to silver denim - jackets, [jeans](https://www.refinery29.com/images/11299564.jpg?format=webp&width=720&height=1080&quality=85), skirts, even dresses - but space-ier fabric is coming. Target is already there. Is it just the 2000s coming back or is it inspired by our most recent forays into space? Shall we call it Elon Musk-core? 


No, we shall not, ew. 


It may seem like [a lot of statement](https://wild-swans.com/cdn/shop/files/Stine-Goya-Rocky-Jacket-_2_1200x.jpg?v=1686838851), and it can be, but not necessarily. If you’re not ready to invest all your money in silver, you can start with something small, like an accessory. A silver bag is easy, but even more current - a pair of silver shoes. [Silver Jadons](https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/jadon-max-boot-metallic-leather-platforms/p/30780058) are still on sale if you’re an unhinged Dr. Martens stan like me, or you can go for a subtler, more classic, or ~feminine~ option of a heeled silver boot, preferably with a pointed toe. 



##Best way to wear it: 




The best way to wear it, in my opinion, is [top to bottom silver for a baked potato-core look](https://compass-media.vogue.it/photos/5f2ac8edbafee3bc00ef712c/master/w_2580%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1044806960.jpg) but if you’re not there yet, one silver element with a monochrome look is fine, too. We’ve already covered shoes and bags, but a jacket is an easy statement “topper” as well. 



#6 ruffles



Another nod to the 2000s - although it’s less of a nod, and more of a full-on head tilt - [delicate, sheer ruffled blouses](https://cdn-images.farfetch-contents.com/20/88/82/93/20888293_50852396_600.jpg) and [dresses](https://static.zara.net/photos///2023/I/T/1/p/0808/133/512/2/w/824/0808133512_1_1_1.jpg?ts=1692868697396) are quickly capturing the imagination of trendy consumers and lining up for fall. The vibe is light, feminine, and diaphanous. 



[This type of top](https://i.localised.com/img/uo/product/71b3e969-42fa-4cb2-b347-52803095bc87.jpg) or dress can be worn by itself, but it also works great with a blazer or leather jacket on top, for a peek of something cute under otherwise masculine-leaning or serious outerwear. 



##Best way to wear it:

I think coats with belts and waist ties are probably coming to replace the straight, masculine coats of recent years (that I'll be sad to see go!).

Zara,"Well, I tend to be a careful shopper anyways, but recently, I've liked the stuff I've gotten from:

* Everlane: I like the fit and material of their tees. I don't expect them to be top-notch quality since they were dirt cheap.
* Urban Outfitters: I've been shopping here for years and never regretted a purchase. UO, for all its hype and overpriced random hipster shit, has a lot of stuff that hits my vibe just right.
* Zara: I like the shoes. Not so sure about the quality of the other items (bought a dress once... zipper broke within minutes), but the shoes feel more high-end.

Edit: Everlane isn't dirt cheap. Upwards of $20 for a tee is obscene. I caught them during their winter sale and got three shirts that I liked a little under $30, which, for me, is well within my budget.

I should also probably say that the things I buy from the above stores are mostly pants and shoes. I wouldn't be able to speak for the tops- I avoid them, since they do appear to be lower quality. UO also sells third-party (for lack of a better word) brands that are better quality than the base itself. Zara is obviously fast fashion, and you just have to be careful.

As people with the 10 year old H&M T-shirt can attest, sometimes cheaper IS better. It just produced 10L of toxic runoff and was made from industrial cotton and virgin polyester.

not sure if we have the same line up, I think in Europe we got a reduced lineup or something. You mean the non itchy turtlenecks? or the silk cardigans? The ladies sweaters this year were thicker materials, some yak and some Aran and some Merino. I was very tempeted by the Aran sweater, but decided I I did not need it. I do have an Aran like sweater of theirs but 100% organic cotton which is 2-3 years old now and maybe the softest knit ever, and very useful for summer nights. They have ones just like it, but different colors in store right now.

otherwise the flannel shirts are lovely, IMO a bit thicker than Uniqlo's and all their shirts really fit me well. The flannel pyjamas seem promising but the proportions are off to me, so that was a no-go.

edit to add - their shirts fit me great and are not opaque - I got a chambray one I particularly like. I love the double gauze shirts (I got one, and bought SO several), which is something really difficult to find anywhere else and double gauze is so much more comfortable when it is really hot, and looks neater rather than rumpled and I find the subtle blue weave patternsreally beautiful.

the thick cotton bretons are a lot heavier than other versions I can think of, like they should. the tshirts I have a fit problem so basically only have one. The underwear is high cotton and I find the bikini model particularly amazing comfortable - the dark colors last better and btw size down, because it stretches a bit, but it is very comfortable right from the start.

Gap,"I've always had trouble finding pants or jeans that fit me because I'm short. I'm 5'1"", 120 lbs, with a 28in waist and a 35.5in hips. I think my ideal inseam length is 30 inches. I really love mid-waist loose straight jeans, where the bottom kind of slouches at my ankle onto my shoes (like this: [https://pin.it/4gMCmLHLX](https://pin.it/4gMCmLHLX) ). I only own one pair of jeans like these (Gap Straight Loose) and I would like a black version. I am also seeking jeans similar to these Empyre Loiter Slouchy Black Denim Jeans ([here's the link to them](https://www.zumiez.com/empyre-loiter-slouchy-black-wash-straight-leg-denim-jeans.html) ), in black and with that type of slouch and bagginess. I don't really like wide leg jeans since I think they just kind of make me look weird from the side. Also, what measurements matter when buying baggy jeans? Does the hip to waist ratio matter that much or should what fit be the waist only? Do you have any advice on buying jeans in general? Thanks.   
Edit: I don't mind when my jeans barely touch the floor, but I'd prefer if they didn't trip me.",0.10726495726495726,0.531054131054131,positive
Gap,"It sounds like you might find the sidebar guides helpful, especially the [fit and proportion](https://www.reddit.com/comments/15sej6) guide. In general I don't use advice or follow any one person with a body type similar to mine (I am 5'5 with a similar shape to yours though I suppose almost all my muscular definition is in my lower body due to fencing)--I find it more useful to think about what shapes/silhouettes I want to make and then translate what I like looking at into something that works for me.

\-What style of blouse won't make me look 3 sizes bigger than I actually am, or a nice blazer, and how to layer shirts under blazers without looking bulky?

I mean that generally depends on what style of blouse you're looking for. I answered a similar question about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1jcj0v9/comment/mi7m48x/?context=3) about what kinds of necklines to look for (as someone with a larger bust, I included photo examples). This [inspo album](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/v4ptw6/old_hollywood_cues_for_them_broad_broads_an_inspo/) is probably useful as well. If you're looking for a blazer, this [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1j34fwt/who_do_you_think_makes_the_best_womens_suits/) about suits is probably useful. When wearing suits, I personally tend to dress androgynously so I look for blazers that don't nip in at the waist, and are longer and have stronger shoulders (and my comment on that post has some brand recs). Other folks like a really feminine look, and have posted their recommendations. Blazers are generally expected to be worn over other layers, if it looks bulky with clothes underneath it, that is generally a good indication that the blazer is too small.

\-What dress style will look casual and fun instead of looking like I'm going clubbing?

There are a lot of dress options that don't look like club wear, in the summer [they're](https://www.jcrew.com/p/womens/categories/clothing/dresses-and-jumpsuits/cotton-voile-midi-dress-in-block-print/CI679) [usually](https://www.katespadeoutlet.com/products/rooftop-garden-floral-greenwich-dress/K8564-100.html) [sundresses](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/smocked-tie-front-maxi-dress-56727824), but they could also be more [dressed](https://selkiecollection.com/products/the-rainbow-puff-dress?variant=39692141232222) [up](https://www.zimmermann.com/us/ready-to-wear/clothing/dresses/dresses-short/illuminate-flounce-mini-dress-blue-agate.html). In the fall or winter they tend to be [midi dresses](https://selkiecollection.com/products/the-puck-foxglove-dress) or [sweater dresses](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=536124002&vid=1&tid=brpl005698&kwid=1#pdp-page-content). Generally the fabric and fit are good indicators of whether a dress is club wear or not.

\-What casual shirts will look okay without making me look like a slob?  
I don't know how casual you're trying to be--but the oversized tee from the 2010s that covers the hips is generally going to look childish or dated (especially if paired with tight jeans or leggings--unless you're going for a loose-loose look--[here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1j2w0l2/embrace_taking_up_space/) a useful recent guide on that). In general fitted tees that end at the hip or are cropped or looser boxy and cropped tees are what's popular (take a look at [these tees](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/clothing/tshirts) for example). 

\-What can I wear besides skinny leggings that will look more put together but still fit odd measurements?

Right now wide leg jeans and trousers are in (admittedly amongst younger people they are lower rise) and those are pretty comfortable on muscular legs while still fitting at the waist. Making sure you're buying from a brand that works with your proportions is useful, but as I don't know your measurements I can't make a good rec. I'd recommend searching this sub for jeans or trouser recommendations (especially recent ones that will help with looking current). I think [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11cp9nb/your_wardrobe_is_outdated_what_now_step_1_skinny/) on updated clothing might be a useful way to think of modern silhouettes. I personally check hip waist measurements and resign myself to taking in all my trousers at the waist--though abercrombie's curvy line and free people's CRVE have actually been pretty curvy in that their trousers fit my hips and my waist, whereas usually I find that anything that actually fits me (aka fits the largest part of my body) has to be taken in at the waist for it to sit properly.",0.13543040293040293,0.4572741147741147,positive

meh, is it? Acrylic doesn't keep great over time, but this bottom-dollar cashmere keeps even worse and doesn't feel so great either. I guess it's marginally more sustainable because it's not made from fossil fuel byproducts, but the manufacturer is still investing capital and labor into a product that's designed to last a season or two. moreover, a bunch of Quince etc customers in the past would have bought one sweater on sale or second hand that, even if they only wore it for 1-2 seasons, would come out of it usable by someone else or for something else, whereas these disintegrate into tatters more often than I'd like. quince isn't the only company that does this - it's distinguishable by its business model more than anything else - but it's still disposable fast fashion. idk that it's a pareto improvement over the proverbial zara in pretty much any sense.",0.23444444444444448,0.5477777777777777,positive

Uniqlo,"Tagging on here:

I ordered the popular $50 cashmere crew neck sweater in black and camel. I’ve mostly owned Uniqlo cashmere crewneck, so I was interested in the cheaper price. Long story short, it’s half the price for half the quality. I returned both because I’m just accustomed to a nicer sweater.

The material was much thinner. Nearly see-through compared to Uniqlo. The fit was slimmer, but I somehow just didn’t like it with their sweater. The camel color had a pink undertone and does not work with pale skin that also has a pink undertone. M

And the biggest I didn’t like was the neck. It had non-stretchy rim to the neck that felt cheap. Like if you put it on too fast and it accidentally stretched, you’ll start popping threads. The Uniqlo sweaters have a completely stretchy neck that just feels like the rest of the sweater. Much higher quality.

This doesn’t mean that the Uniqlo sweaters are without fault. All of mine developed holes at the seam under my right armpit only. Very weird defect, but I’m going to buy more anyways because it’s not super noticeable when it’s on. Overall, they’re my favorite until I’m willing to spend the money on a different brand again. Also, I would like to see some more unique colors or even pattern/texture with these.",0.1053608630952381,0.4964546130952381,positive

Gap,"I’ve been eyeing that diamond Alpaca sweater for a while and I agree that the description is misleading. I’m curious about the quality of their merino, but I guess it wouldn’t matter so much if that vest was itchy bc I’d basically always layer it. I am curious to try the Yak sweater in case I can get one without a defect lol. 

I find their cashmere pretty itchy and it doesn’t really feel like cashmere. That said, I kept the crewneck cashmere sweatshirt anyways because I liked the fit and wanted something cheap I didn’t have to worry about for travel. 

I really like the cut and fit of their silk cami. I am currently debating whether to keep or return the silk slip dresses I tried. The cut isn’t as flattering on me as others but I love that they’re so affordable for genuine silk. I also tried the silk halter dress and the sizing/fit was totally different, it was way too big in the same size. A couple colors of the silk slip dress fit a little differently despite being the same size, which is one of my pet peeves. I remember that a lot from Abercrombie jeans growing up and it’s one reason I avoid them now, they were the worst with this. 

I also tried a lot of their linen. For the price, I think the quality is fine. I kept two linen long sleeve button downs. They do gap at the chest, but Quince isn’t the first brand that I’ve had this issue with.

I have a pretty straight body so my waist is wider and my hips more narrow than typical women’s pants. I’m wondering if the pants you tried might actually be a good fit for me (I have such a hard time finding stuff that works).",0.15796568627450983,0.5183823529411766,positive

I’ve recently discovered Madewell Jeans. I’m still figuring them out. I currently have tried about 10-12 different styles and colors, I have kept 2. I do love the magic pockets, and I love a good ankle denim. I’ve found JCrew and sometimes Banana are still too slim cut for me.

My preference is for the curvy fit because of the waistband.

The non-curvy fit, I had my tailor add a little tuck in the waistband, but that’s where I really notice a difference, in addition to the rise. The rise is different between the Kickout Crops, which you wouldn’t expect.

The things I pay extra close attention to at Madewell now are:
1. Rise (on each of their items in the website. In the store the associates I spoke with weren’t aware of the differences in the rise, but we got a tape measure and measured together and they were super excited to learn about it)

Gap,"No, flat out, vanity sizing. your timeline's too recent to be honest. You're what, 23? For reference, I am 36. I'm comparing this to my entire shopping experience, I have been the same size for over 20 years, roughly, and I'm a habitual, nearly compulsive shopper. This is the 1st time I've run into an issue with finding a proper fit. Normally I'm the info source for all my friends, so your tips made me laugh. HARD. I appreciate the help, but shape knowledge isn't the issue. 

My weight is within 5 lbs of what it was when I graduated from high school in 1996. I was a size EIGHT in high school, size NINE or ELEVEN in jeans. I am a size 0/00 if I'm lucky now, or 23/24, or 1 in juniors. WTF. That's vanity sizing. I'm not the smallest person out there by far. So it's weird. I do have some older pants that fit me, but they're falling apart, so I went back out to search for new ones, and started running into issues.

Again, the reason I ended up where I did has to do in part with my build and age. I have long legs, so many stores don't carry inseams long enough. j.crew used to have a 33"" inseam on their regular pants, which was awesome. They also tend to have many midrise pants, which is great. I don't want low rise, because of my age.

I didn't say I'm totally sized out of stores. I am specifically sized out of Old Navy, Ann Taylor/Loft, Gap, Banana Republic (never fit right into their stuff anyhow, this is more to do with the cut than vanity sizing there-they all run long in the torso/short in the leg and fit wrong on me.), uh....can't recall what the other store was that I was sized out of this year.  It surprised me.

Kate Spade pants fit wrong. Too tight in the calf. No luck at Urban Outfitters. Too....skin tight? When I sized up, too saggy/sad.

J.Crew's jeans have never fit me, they're always huge in the hips/butt and skin-tight in the calves and ankles. The reason why they don't work is because they're designed for a woman with a more pronounced difference between her hips and legs than I have (I'm a broad-shouldered hourglass). 

Madewell isn't as aggressively trendy/try-hard as J.Crew is these days, so their sizing is generally more consistent. They may work for you if you're a slim hourglass. I would really suggest that you try jeans on before ordering because the only thing more personal/variable than them is underwear (ie: bras).

Here's what I've got:

**Sweaters:** Mango, Scotch & Soda, Vince, and I love to hit up vintage/thrift stores for fun vintage sweaters. For sweatshirts/hoodies, I usually find an Adidas/Nike one on discount at Nordstrom Rack. I'm hoping to get a nice Fairisle sweater on sale from Nordstrom soon, and I'm looking at brands Marine Layer, Barbour, LL Bean, and Dedicated Brand.

**Jeans/Pants/Shorts:** Madewell, Reformation, Levi's. I also used to find great vintage 90s high-rise jeans for cheap at thrift stores, then cut and hem them into shorts. Unfortunately [most thrift stores carry mostly fast-fashion garbage brands](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/style/thrift-stores-fast-fashion.html) instead of quality vintage jeans or shorts . That's where I turn to Poshmark, Etsy, etc to find denim shorts now, but even then it can take some serious scouring. I've found some gems from Tommy Hilfiger and Lee, and if you grew up in the 90s you know those brands were IT.

**Leggings:** Lululemon (I know I'm basic, don't care), Aerie, formerly American Apparel til they shut down. I still am bitter about that. (But fuck Dov Charney.)

**Skirts:** Formerly Modcloth (haven't bought from them recently so I can't vouch for them now and have heard their quality has deteriorated), vintage printed skirts on Etsy (TRUST ME), Reformation, Anthropologie, and I recently got this [great piece](https://www.revolve.com/ena-pelly-bella-woven-mini-skirt/dp/ENAR-WQ6/?d=Womens&page=1&lc=1&itrownum=1&itcurrpage=1&itview=05&size=6%2FXS&code=ENAR-WQ6) from a brand called Ella Peny that I'm working on filling out a bit more (lost a lot of my curves in recent years thanks to ADHD meds and WFH life).

**Tees/Tanks**: Everlane, & Other Stories organic cotton, James Perse, Hanes, and Gildan although they're kind of evil. I love the look, feel, and quality of a classic crewneck Gildan sweatshirt.

**Tops (Work-Friendly):** J. Crew, Everlane, Anthropologie, Banana Republic (they make a perfect white button-down) Madewell

**Tops (Going Out or Casual):** Zara, Express, Free People, UO (unfortunately), Aritzia, ASOS, Tobi, Topshop. I so desperately wish I could say Sezane but their sizing is whack af in my experience. I like their simple, elegant Gaspard jumper, but always have to wear a layer underneath because it's ridiculously itchy and gives my sensitive skin literal hives.

**Shoes/Boots:** CROCS (YES BITCH, CROCS--and I mean that for flip-flops, platform sandals, AND the standard Croc), Uggs for great winter boots, Hunters for rain boots, Toms for both casual flats and classy sandals/wedges, Reebok/Nike for sneakers, Born for oxfords/flats, and Frye for boots that could go to war. I'm dying to try out Sam Edelman booties and trade them out for my Timberland combat boots which are of a nice quality, but sadly my feet just do not like (and that's after lots of wearing in).

**Dresses:** Hands down, Reformation wins the ""sexy/flattering dress"" contest. Lulu's is also good, Aritzia (specifically the Wilfred brand).

H&M,"Here are a few of my closet staples that have lasted for years. Note: I do wash everything cold and tumble dry low. There are some pieces that I will wear multiple times between washes.

-Uniqlo Turtlenecks: I have two, one in black the other in grey. Perfect layering pieces. Had these for a few years and other than my body growing, they still fit and are in great shape.

-Abercrombie and Fitch Skinny/Jeggings: By far my favorite, long lasting jeans. Just some simple, no tears or wears, solid colored jeans. As mentioned, I’ve gained a lot of weight so I did out grow them, but I know they will still be in perfect shape once I fit into them again.

-H&M Basic T-Shirts: I’m sure many will disagree with me, but I have two solid-colored t-shirts that I have had for years now. Cheap and when I cold wash/tumble dry low, those pieces still keep up with the wear.

-Abercrombie and Fitch Button-Ups: I know, a repeat in brand, but I love their button-ups and those have lasted for years. 

I downsized my closet a year ago and those are some of the pieces I’ve kept. I don’t buy crazy colors and the only patterns I buy are stripes and plaid.",0.10483870967741934,0.5291730670762929,positive
H&M,"Here's my list of items I own that seem like they're going to last forever. These are all items I wear and launder once a week, with no special treatment:

1. Jcrew vintage tees. I can't vouch for the more recent ones. The ones I own are at least a decade old now. Yes they've faded but they have otherwise held up wash after wash and wear after wear. I keep meaning to refresh these but I don't need to. The exception is the white versions: those got stained and wore through faster. But the grey, blue, black tees are still going strong. 

2. Old Navy tank tops and sleep boxer shorts (100% cotton). I have ON tank tops that are more than a decade old and they're only now starting to get a little thread bare, but I sleep in them so it doesn't matter. That said, I can't say the same about their tees: a lot of them just wrinkle and twist out of shape and look ratty too soon (unlike my Jcrew tees). 

3. Crz Yoga leggings. There are some styles that do pill after a few wears, but if you get the ones that don't (and sometimes it's a crapshoot when you order-- you may be sent the crappy ones!), my goodness do they last and last. Wear after wear, and I do put them through the wringer. 

4. Old Navy dynamic fleece hoodies. A most worn item. I do baby mine a bit and don't wash it after every wear. But it does wash up well and looks great, no pilling, fading, twisting, etc. 

5. Banana Republic merino wool sweaters. Again, I can't vouch for the more recent versions, but I have collected these over the past decade and they are still going strong. I do baby these as well and I'm careful when I launder. They don't need frequent laundering because merino repels odors. Some colors pill more than others, so you never know.

6. Minus33 merino zip tops. I have two, and wear them all the time in the fall through the spring. Still going strong, I think they're 5 years old. No pills. 

7. Patagonia NanoPuff. Mine is 10+ years old, it is starting to get some loose threads around the cuffs because I often tie it around my waist, but I can return it and have it fixed. It also gets worn daily Fall into Spring and on hikes and such, and gets taken on my travels (packed up in its pocket). I.e., I do not baby it at all, in fact, I'm rough on it. 

8. Recliner NYC sleep wear. I love this brand so much. Over the pandemic I invested in their pjs and second skin night dress. I like fresh pj's every day and wear the pj sets for lounging, so I do launder these weekly and most colors have not pilled or faded and still look brand new. (There is one exception, a special color, that did pill). This includes the very first purchase I ever made which was probably about 7 years ago: that night dress is still going strong, no pills, fading, etc. 

9. Socks: I really like the Allbirds athletic socks. They get washed after every wear and are still holding up all this time (4 years). Most other socks lose their elasticity or get holes. 

10. Old Navy athletic tees -- I think the Breathe line? I have had them for years. Worn and washed weekly. Still going strong. Have not picked up any odors either, although I do not use fabric softener so maybe that helps. The worst damage is that the label inside has worn out so I can't tell you which version. 

Most everything else that's held up just doesn't get worn as often, or under as heavy conditions, and with such regular laundering. Or, my preferences or weight changes before I could wear it out. 

Meanwhile over my lifetime I have bought items from all price ranges and had things fall apart after 2 wears. It's so frustrating! Price is not a consideration anymore; as you can see with my list, many of these items are not all that expensive. In fact I remember some F21 and H&M items that lasted forever and ever.... only getting replaced when my size changed. They just would not die!",0.1141867460897312,0.4140829319933797,positive

**Skirts:** Formerly Modcloth (haven't bought from them recently so I can't vouch for them now and have heard their quality has deteriorated), vintage printed skirts on Etsy (TRUST ME), Reformation, Anthropologie, and I recently got this [great piece](https://www.revolve.com/ena-pelly-bella-woven-mini-skirt/dp/ENAR-WQ6/?d=Womens&page=1&lc=1&itrownum=1&itcurrpage=1&itview=05&size=6%2FXS&code=ENAR-WQ6) from a brand called Ella Peny that I'm working on filling out a bit more (lost a lot of my curves in recent years thanks to ADHD meds and WFH life).

**Tees/Tanks**: Everlane, & Other Stories organic cotton, James Perse, Hanes, and Gildan although they're kind of evil. I love the look, feel, and quality of a classic crewneck Gildan sweatshirt.

**Tops (Work-Friendly):** J. Crew, Everlane, Anthropologie, Banana Republic (they make a perfect white button-down) Madewell

**Tops (Going Out or Casual):** Zara, Express, Free People, UO (unfortunately), Aritzia, ASOS, Tobi, Topshop. I so desperately wish I could say Sezane but their sizing is whack af in my experience. I like their simple, elegant Gaspard jumper, but always have to wear a layer underneath because it's ridiculously itchy and gives my sensitive skin literal hives.

**Shoes/Boots:** CROCS (YES BITCH, CROCS--and I mean that for flip-flops, platform sandals, AND the standard Croc), Uggs for great winter boots, Hunters for rain boots, Toms for both casual flats and classy sandals/wedges, Reebok/Nike for sneakers, Born for oxfords/flats, and Frye for boots that could go to war. I'm dying to try out Sam Edelman booties and trade them out for my Timberland combat boots which are of a nice quality, but sadly my feet just do not like (and that's after lots of wearing in).

**Dresses:** Hands down, Reformation wins the ""sexy/flattering dress"" contest. Lulu's is also good, Aritzia (specifically the Wilfred brand).

Zara,"The vast majority of clothes in my wardrobe come from Uniqlo, followed by H&M and the occasional Mango/Zara piece. I own exactly one item from COS, a nice black lyocell blouse.

I currently own one leather handbag that I use all the time, an Oxblood Cambridge Satchel.

H&M,"hmmm...I think you might be conflating a couple things here?

In the jeans example, 100% cotton jeans are a different beast than synthetic blends in a way that is orthogonal to quality. You can get cheap rigid cotton jeans or expensive ones, you can get cheap stretch jeans or expensive ones. That doesn’t mean a $100 pair of stretch jeans will be worth it to you - a lot of $50 denim is comparable quality to $100 denim. 

I also think that it doesn’t quite work to conflate durability and price. For example, a pair of jeans might be more expensive not because it is more durable, but because a lot more work went into the fading and distressing. A cashmere sweater from Naadam probably won’t be more durable than a cotton-poly blend from J. Crew, but it probably will feel softer and nicer. 

That said, it is absolutely true that 1) sometimes you are just paying more for brand names/marketing and 2) there has been a general dive in quality. IIRC another poster who worked in textiles said once that this had to do with a spike in cotton prices, and even after prices returned to normal brands kept sourcing the cheaper versions?

Overall, when it comes to midrange to high end mall brands, I think there is *so much* variability between and within the various factors that make up “quality” (appearance / comfort / durability) that it’s hard to use price as a gauge. I think this is especially true for casual styles (suiting, for example, is a bit different, as are formal gowns).  An average knit shirt from Brooks Brothers might be better than an average knit shirt from Gap, but that doesn’t mean I’ll be surprised if a particular Gap shirt is better than a particular Brooks Brothers shirt. 

“Less & better” also only makes sense if it is *better for your needs/desires*. If American Eagle jeans check all your boxes, and a different brand that is more durable fits you poorly, isn’t as comfortable, and doesn’t have the look you want...it’s not better for you. If you have small kids and all your clothes get stained, a more expensive, better-made t-shirt isn’t better for you, because it’s going to get covered in tomato sauce just as fast as a less expensive H&M tee.",0.08761904761904762,0.5310884353741496,mixed
H&M,"I think it’s about finding the right brand and right piece to invest in. I’ve had similar experiences with Everlane & Ref, they always just fit a little off. Reformation sundresses really feel the same to me as H&M sundresses. I used to shop fast fashion but have been making a conscious effort to buy far less clothing that is more ethical. There are also some brands I won’t compromise on because I just love their quality and I have had some of these pieces for 5-10 years:

-Mother Jeans. Ridiculously expensive, but the best things I’ve ever put on my body. I used to get AE or Madewell jeans. They were ok, but Mother is amazing. They are so comfy I sleep on planes in them, but I still get compliments on my figure in them. Amazing. 

-Lululemon. I hate that I love it. I don’t like the brand image of Lulu at all and I have tried tons of other brands to cut down on price and/or just get something DIFFERENT but I have yet to find an athletic brand that fits as good and looks as chic. 

-Patagonia. The pioneer of sustainable clothing. I love everything Patagonia stands for and they are one of the brands that is ACTUALLY making a difference and not just green washing. I try to purchase any essentials I can from them, like coats/jackets for example. Most people (including myself) can’t get away with wearing their sector of clothing a majority of the time though. 

-L-space swimsuits/Frankies bikinis. I have never been 100% confident in my body, but a great quality swimsuit just makes me feel good. L-space even sent me new bottoms for free even though I got Cheetos on my white suit and it stained it. You’d never get that kind of service from Cupshe or similar. 

In general I do prefer more expensive clothing even if it still in the fast-ish fashion category (Madewell, Anthropologie, etc) so maybe I just have more expensive taste? I just think they tend to have better/more unique prints that you can’t find elsewhere. I try and buy a majority of things second hand though, mostly from Poshmark. I have gotten a lot of new with tags items for 50+% off (including mother jeans). So if I really do feel like splurging I‘ll look on posh first!

If I do see something at H&M (or similar) that I HAVE to have, I make sure that it feels like good quality. I have some mall brand sweaters that have held up for years and I love them just as much as more expensive ones.",0.2212395115172893,0.5285487146598257,positive

H&M,"Oh absolutely. You have every right to like cheaper clothes over more expensive ones! And I absolutely agree that cheaper or mid market clothing can oftentimes be much better quality wise than higher end or “ethical” products. I had a pair of jeans from H&M that lasted me 6 years of nearly daily wearing, and the only reason I stopped wearing them was because I gained weight, so.

We all choose to spend our money where and however we like. I personally like to spend money on things I really value. And I value small and local shops and circular economy practices. Over the past year I have bought a lot of made to order clothing from Etsy, and shopped from smaller or more local shops in my area and vintage marketplaces. I’m aware that I’m paying a premium for clothes that may or may not be made better than that on the high street, but I really like being able to determine what goes into my clothes, customise the fit however I want, and to also get responses from the seller/manufacturer about any concerns I have. I am more than willing to spend the extra because I see it as a fair price for the service that I’m getting, and it shows my support for these smaller family labels that may be particularly suffering right now. 

No, I don’t go out of my way to shop from big “ethical” brands like Everlane or Reformation - I don’t see them as much better than, say, COS. And I prefer COS’s cuts personally, so I don’t want to buy from a shop just because they splash “green” on their labels. 

And I don’t shop high end, really, because I don’t see that as a fair price for my clothing. But buying hand crafted linen clothing from a really nice lady and her team on Etsy, who takes the time to write me a thank you note for repeat purchases? I really like that sort of thing. 

Full disclosure - I spend more on clothes because I am privileged enough to earn the money to enable me to do so, but just like I choose to spend more money on better quality food from small shops, I choose to spend my money to support local clothiers.

H&M,"Right there with you. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but I rarely find anything in high-end stores or even J. Crew level stores that I feel is worth the inflated price tags. Price does not equal quality and usually I like the designs of the 'cheap' stores better anyway. So I guess we both have cheap taste, haha

I feel like all brands have some kind of unethical issue somewhere, so that doesn't enter into decisions for me honestly.

Story time - I tried to get away from the fast fashion & be an adult, so I bought an interview suit this year at Ann Taylor. The regular price was over $300. Wore it for literally 6 hours and found snags and loose threads in the collar after. Complete waste of money.

The only things I really intentionally spend more on are boots, winter coats and the occasional purse (and even then it's like $2-400 range, not $1k+).

I’ve heard good things about fashion nova jeans as well.

From an ethical point of view, I think with recent news we’ve gotten good proof that under capitalism there is no true ethical consumption.

Gap,"*cheap in quotations above because I know it’s all relative

As I’ve gotten older, gotten into my groove with my personal style, and as I’ve started to make more money, I’ve tried buying more expensive clothing with the idea of having “fewer but better” items...but I just can’t help coming back to my old, affordable (for me) standbys. I either don’t like the items as much, or I don’t notice a discernible difference in quality to where I think it’s a good value for my money. I’m also pretty much exclusively shopping online right now due to the pandemic, so it’s harder to tell if an item is really worth the higher price tag without seeing the quality in person, being able to try on, etc. 

For example, I wanted to invest in a good pair of jeans recently, and after reading lots of reviews, carefully taking my measurements, really thinking about my decision...I bought a new pair of jeans from GRLFRND for about $100 on sale. I picked a pair of 100% cotton jeans with the idea of “fewer but better”/“buy it for life” in mind, but when I got these jeans in the mail & tried them on...I hated them. They technically “fit” but they were so uncomfortable and unflattering. I guess these are the kinds of jeans I need to “break in”, but that doesn’t work for me. I’m a new mom and I need my clothes to be comfy right away. So back to my American Eagle jeans I go. 

I’m still trying to buy less overall and buy more “classic” pieces that I’ll get lots of wears out of, but I guess I just have cheap taste? 🤷🏻‍♀️

I also want to add a few asides:
-I’ve noticed that brands which I use to think of as “nicer”/“more expensive” from which I could previously only afford heavily discounted items have gone wayyy down in quality over the years. I have a few old items from The Gap and J Crew which I purchased over 10 years ago that still hold up nicely, that are well-stitched, made of high-quality fabric, etc... the last time I got new items from these stores I was disappointed to find they pretty much felt like Forever 21 quality to me. I’m personally bummed because I can finally afford whatever I want from these stores but the quality has gone downhill. 
-Buying from “ethical” companies also seems impossible because apparently they’re all problematic? Like all the recent stuff coming out about how bad Everlane, Reformation, and Los Angeles Apparel are, among others. 

My discussion questions:
Does anyone else prefer cheaper clothes? 

What’s your favorite “cheap” brand? Mine is American Eagle lol

I like LL Bean a lot in that category and occasionally Eddie Bauer. For basic tanks and tees, I’ll sometimes go to Duluth Trading Company, but I’ll also got those from all the other stores listed. I still get my jeans from Gap, but not much else.",-0.10583333333333333,0.5091666666666667,negative
Gap,"I like to pay less for my clothes for sure. In truth, I’m a hunter!! I have innate abilities to find amazing clothes that was really pricy that is now reduced! I also tend to hit up really fancy parts of town and hit their thrift stores. I have found some crazy gems!! (The most beautiful Burberry summer dress for $10 - with tags still on)

I can’t justify spending a ton bc I get bored of clothes super easy. Even beautiful classic pieces, I’ll wear TF out of it for 1-2 years and then one day I’ll just never want to see it again. (My girlfriends are lucky lol)

That being said I love AE, the Gap, Old Navy, etc. I think I grew out of F21. 

I also would MUCH prefer to have a ton of choices that are less expensive than less options that were expensive, ya feel?",0.18001893939393937,0.5631313131313129,positive
Gap,"I agree.  My favourite cheap brand is Old Navy.  I'm always able to find some really great staple summer dresses there, simple lyocell button-ups for the Fall/Winter, leggings.  Plus they have a good website and a good return policy.  Other favourites are: Uniqlo, Gap, Simons (Canada), Joe Fresh (Canada), Zara, American Eagle, Abercrombie (when on sale), and H&M.  I stick with wool (coats), cotton, rayon, and lyocell/tencel for fabrics (avoid jersey and polyester unless it's workout gear) and have had very good durability/longevity with what I've bought over the years.",0.3895454545454546,0.49883116883116885,positive
Gap,"I do find I prefer a number of ""cheaper"" brands - similarly to a lot of people in this sub, I like Uniqlo, American Eagle, Gap, and H&M for different things. I think the most ""expensive"" brands I shop at are Gap and Express, but I only buy when they're running sales. Almost all my occasion dresses are from Express, and I get a fair amount of compliments on them! I especially appreciate how even cheaper brands are expanding their size range to include a full range of petite sizes, which my 4'11 self desperately needs especially when it comes to maxi dresses/jumpsuits/etc.

In my opinion I feel like a lot of more ""expensive"" brands will put some sort of embellishment on simple/staple items that I just don't care for (I know cheap/mall brands do this as well, but e.g. I can always count on Uniqlo for simple basics). I agree, I tend to splurge a little more on shoes, but even then I tend to prefer mid-range prices and only buy on sale.",0.05514705882352941,0.6592436974789916,mixed
Gap,"I totally get it, as a teen making my own money for the first time and a college student scraping by I totally loved cheap clothes. However, I caution you to think about WHY they’re cheap. I recommend watching the documentary called The True Cost. Incredibly eye opening. The cheap fashion industry is a huge polluter of the world, and the human rights violations of fast fashion are insane. Most of the (mostly women) working in these horrible conditions for next to nothing making GAP clothes still can’t afford to send their children to school even after working 14 hour shifts daily. I highly recommend researching fast fashion, it’s a life changer. I’ve never shopped the same! 

I highly recommend thrift shops for affordable, ethical, and sustainable fashion. I’ve found forever 21 clothes next to Armani, and oftentimes they cost the same depending on your thrift store! You can also shop second hand online, though a little bit more pricey, but still cheaper than new. I’ve even got super cute Victoria’s Secret bras/lingerie brand new with the tags on from PoshMark, they seller bought it in the wrong size and couldn’t return it! 

You can also find a tailor in your area to help you make the things you have/find that are a little big/ill fitting for you better. Tailors typically aren’t too expensive but they will make you look alike a million bucks! My boyfriend had his hand me down suit tailored and he looks so fancy shmancy in it now 😂

It’s also just nice to know you’re supporting a local small business, so I recommend Tailors for that! I applaud you trying to switch to more mindful shopping, and I know it’s super hard. But I hope these suggestions help you! ❤️",0.11398139558853843,0.5140063904349619,positive
Gap,"I can afford and often buy ""BIFL"" or more expensive brands, but I often prefer the styles of cheap clothes (hello, Target designer collabs!) They are of-the-moment, they're lower maintenance, I feel less bad when I inevitably spill wine on them, etc. I get it.

Those cheap clothes still fill in landfills and many of them are made by slave labor. So I now try to buy (1) long-lasting, (2) ethical, (3) sustainable clothing. That isn't ""transparent w/o middleman"" or ""luxury"" or ""minimalist"" even though some brands (Everlane) try to confuse you that they are the same - it doesn't mean white-girl-Instagram style either (Reformation).

Some brands I like, all with very different aesthetic: Patagonia, Prana, COS (their sustainable materials especially), Ellen Fischer, Equipment, Theory, Aritzia and yes GAP. You're right that everyone's materials include poly now. Be careful and buy the 100% cotton, 100% silk, 100% wool pieces and the quality is still there (even with Aritzia!) if you look.",0.03876984126984129,0.637436507936508,mixed

Gap,"Mom here as well. 

I have never spent $100 on anything to wear other than something that might be considered ""gear"" ie hiking boots. I'm greenish and frugalish. So many brands that were once considered quality aren't much different than the target racks. I have the exact same black v neck from target and from gap. The price difference was $30. I literally cant tell which is which unless I see the tag. 

I have a couple heirloom pieces from my mom (she and grandma were tres chic), and a couple quality staples from thrift stores. Everything else is unfortunately supplied by hand me downs and the convenience of target because I already shop there for certain things and the clothes are just there.",0.024735449735449742,0.43941798941798943,neutral
Gap,"There’s specific things from certain affordable brands where the quality really shines. I used to work at gap a couple of years ago and their jeans are still holding up strong, along with their tank tops. Other things seemed of a similar quality to H&M so I didn’t bother buying them. I’ve heard good things about fashion nova jeans as well.

From an ethical point of view, I think with recent news we’ve gotten good proof that under capitalism there is no true ethical consumption. If you’re buying from a fast fashion brand you might be adding to harmful practices in third world countries, but if you’re buying clothes made in the US you might be adding to an insidious company culture that treats their workers like shit. It’s just picking your poison at this point.",0.1565079365079365,0.4736507936507936,positive
Gap,"I have a very complete closet, and all I feel the urge to buy these days are fun, trendy tops that will only be trendy for one or two seasons. So my favorite place to shop is Forever 21, which actually has some great pieces that last if you're willing to put in the legwork of reading reviews and scrolling through pages and pages to find the right item. I've been shopping at Forever 21 for such a long time that even without reviews, I can take an educated guess on whether something I really like will turn out to be ok quality/durability in person.

My dress code at work is business formal, and it or not I've found tops at Forever 21 that are just as good as what you can find at Ann Taylor/LOFT/Banana Republic/Gap these days, but cheaper and without the fake sales. Probably part of why all of those companies got into deep financial trouble! I pair them with my Theory blazers and no one is the wiser.",0.2032857142857143,0.5261190476190476,positive
Gap,"The few things I've tried from Everlane were really disappointing both in fit and quality. Won't try again. Didn't keep anything. 

It kind of sucks, but a lot of my basics I just like the good old Gap and JCrew versions. good vnecks that last a while, Gap jeans are the ones that fit me best, decent prices. I try to venture out but the fit never is as good, and the quality is usually on par or not as good. 

I'd happily support more sustainable/ethical brands if the items look good, even for more money! But they almost never do.",0.3570833333333333,0.4841666666666667,positive
Mango,"I really like H&M and MANGO.  I know they're both ethically atrocious, but as a medical student I can only afford to spend maybe $500 on clothes each year, I need (most of) them to be appropriate in casual AND professional settings, and above all, *I need to not care if I accidentally get vomit or blood on them.*",0.011111111111111112,0.474074074074074,neutral
Mango,"The vast majority of clothes in my wardrobe come from Uniqlo, followed by H&M and the occasional Mango/Zara piece. I own exactly one item from COS, a nice black lyocell blouse. To be honest, at this point in time I don't find the higher price tag on more premium brands to be worth it to me, a young professional who still isn't earning big big bucks. Although there's no denying that my COS lyocell blouse feels much thicker and nicer than my many Uniqlo rayon blouses, do I like it \*that\* much more than my Uniqlo ones that makes it worth the 3x higher price tag? No...and most of my clothes from high street brands last me a good 2-3 years no problem, by which time I'd have gotten bored of them anyway and would have replaced them with something else. 

Where I find it more worth it to splurge is accessories. I prefer to get my shoes from Clarks, for example, because the difference in quality is just so obvious to me and make a big difference to the quality of your experience whilst wearing them. I currently own one leather handbag that I use all the time, an Oxblood Cambridge Satchel. I have a watch from Tissot that I bought on a special occasion and that I'm very fond of, as well as a couple of solid gold rings that I bought to wear without having to worry about them tarnishing. I feel like these ""signature"" pieces are more worth the money to spend on and make my outfit look and feel more ""expensive"" even if I'm just wearing all high street brands.",0.23406692406692411,0.44666023166023155,positive
Madewell,"I think it’s about finding the right brand and right piece to invest in. I’ve had similar experiences with Everlane & Ref, they always just fit a little off. Reformation sundresses really feel the same to me as H&M sundresses. I used to shop fast fashion but have been making a conscious effort to buy far less clothing that is more ethical. There are also some brands I won’t compromise on because I just love their quality and I have had some of these pieces for 5-10 years:

-Mother Jeans. Ridiculously expensive, but the best things I’ve ever put on my body. I used to get AE or Madewell jeans. They were ok, but Mother is amazing. They are so comfy I sleep on planes in them, but I still get compliments on my figure in them. Amazing. 

-Lululemon. I hate that I love it. I don’t like the brand image of Lulu at all and I have tried tons of other brands to cut down on price and/or just get something DIFFERENT but I have yet to find an athletic brand that fits as good and looks as chic. 

-Patagonia. The pioneer of sustainable clothing. I love everything Patagonia stands for and they are one of the brands that is ACTUALLY making a difference and not just green washing. I try to purchase any essentials I can from them, like coats/jackets for example. Most people (including myself) can’t get away with wearing their sector of clothing a majority of the time though. 

-L-space swimsuits/Frankies bikinis. I have never been 100% confident in my body, but a great quality swimsuit just makes me feel good. L-space even sent me new bottoms for free even though I got Cheetos on my white suit and it stained it. You’d never get that kind of service from Cupshe or similar. 

In general I do prefer more expensive clothing even if it still in the fast-ish fashion category (Madewell, Anthropologie, etc) so maybe I just have more expensive taste? I just think they tend to have better/more unique prints that you can’t find elsewhere. I try and buy a majority of things second hand though, mostly from Poshmark. I have gotten a lot of new with tags items for 50+% off (including mother jeans). So if I really do feel like splurging I‘ll look on posh first!

If I do see something at H&M (or similar) that I HAVE to have, I make sure that it feels like good quality. I have some mall brand sweaters that have held up for years and I love them just as much as more expensive ones.",0.2212395115172893,0.5285487146598257,positive

Also, I work in Tech. I find Nordstrom Rack is a good place to find nice but cheap clothes that will satisfy work and toddler life.",0.2545454545454545,0.4625,positive
